# AWS EC2 Instances not running FlexNet Inventory Agent

## What it does

This policy uses a Flexnet Manger Cloud/On-premise instance and checks all EC2 instances running in AWS to determine if the FlexNet Inventory Agent is running on the instance and reports on any that are missing the agent.
The policy is a recommendation only policy, no action is taken during the Policy Escalation.

## Functional Description

The policy leverages the cloud API to get all current EC2 instances and the FlexNet Manager report (Custom view) API to get all AWS cloud instances with agent. It cross-checks the two lists to determine if any instances are running on the cloud that aren't known to FlexNet Manager.  The policy matches the InstanceCloudID from FlexNet Manager System and the instanceId from AWS.

Current limitations:

- Output is limited to max 100000 rows.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.
