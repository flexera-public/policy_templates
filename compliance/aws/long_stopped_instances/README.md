# AWS Long Stopped EC2 Instances

## What It Does

This policy finds AWS EC2 instances in the given account which have been stopped for more than a user-specified number of days and emails a report containing a list of the offending instances. Optionally, the policy will terminate the instances after user approval.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [More information is available in our documentation.](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Regions List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Regions List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - A list of regions to allow or deny for an AWS account. Please enter the regions code if SCP is enabled. See [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Exclusion Tags (Key:Value)* - Cloud native tags to ignore resources that you don't want to produce recommendations for. Use Key:Value format for specific tag key/value pairs, and Key:\* format to match any resource with a particular key, regardless of value. Examples: env:production, DO_NOT_DELETE:\*
- *Stopped Days* - The number of days an instance needs to be stopped to include it in the incident report.
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example, if a user selects the "Terminate Instances" action while applying the policy, all the EC2 instances that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be terminated.

## Policy Actions

The following policy actions are taken on any resources found to be out of compliance.

- Send an email report
- Terminate long stopped instances after an approval

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `ec2:DescribeRegions`
  - `ec2:DescribeInstances`
  - `ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus`*
  - `ec2:TerminateInstances`*
  - `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics`
  - `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`
  - `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`
  - `sts:GetCallerIdentity`

  \* Only required for taking action (termination); the policy will still function in a read-only capacity without these permissions.

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                  "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                  "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                  "ec2:TerminateInstances",
                  "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                  "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                  "cloudwatch:ListMetric",
                  "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
