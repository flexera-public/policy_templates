# AWS Long-Stopped Instances

## What it does

This policy checks all instances that are stopped and reports on any that have been stopped for more than a specified period of time. The user is given the option to Terminate the instance after approval.

### Input Parameters

### Cloud Management Required Permissions/AWS Required Permissions

- Cloud Management - The `credential_viewer`, `policy_designer`, `policy_manager` & `policy_publisher` roles
- AWS - The `CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess` AWS IAM Policy

### AWS Required Permissions

This policy requires permissions to describe AWS ECS DescribeInstances and Get Metric Statistics from the AWS Cloudwatch API.
The Cloud Management Platform automatically creates two Credentials when connecting AWS to Cloud Management; AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. The IAM user credentials contained in those credentials will require the following permissions:

```javascript
{
  "Version": "2016-11-15",
  "Statement":[{
  "Effect":"Allow",
  "Action":["ec2: DescribeInstances"],
    "Resource":"*"
    }
  ]
}
```

```javascript
{
  "Version": "2010-08-01",
  "Statement":[{
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":["cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"],
      "Resource":"*",
      "Condition":{
         "Bool":{
            "aws:SecureTransport":"true"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
