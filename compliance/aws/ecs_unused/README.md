# AWS Unused ECS Clusters

## What it does

This policy checks all ECS clusters to determine if any are unused (no registered instances, no running tasks, no pending tasks, no active services) and offers the option to delete the cluster after manual approval.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS API to determine if the ECS cluster is in use.

When an unused ECS cluster is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. Users then have the option to delete the cluster after manual approval if needed.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed Regions* - A list of allowed regions for an AWS account. Please enter the allowed regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Ignore tags* - ECS clusters with any of these tags will be ignored
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Delete Clusters" action while applying the policy, all the resources that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be deleted.
