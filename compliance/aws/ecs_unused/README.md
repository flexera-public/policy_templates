# AWS Unused ECS Clusters

## What it does

This policy checks all ECS clusters to determine if any are unused (no registered instances, no running tasks, no pending tasks, no active services) and offers the option to delete the cluster after manual approval.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS API to determine if the ECS cluster is in use.

When an unused ECS cluster is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. Users then have the option to delete the cluster after manual approval if needed.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Ignore tags* - ECS clusters with any of these tags will be ignored

## Policy Actions

- Send an email report
