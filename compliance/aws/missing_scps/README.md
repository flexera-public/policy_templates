# AWS Accounts Missing Service Control Policies

## What It Does

This policy template checks every AWS account in the AWS organization to see if the user-specified list of Service Control Policies are applied in all accounts. A report is generated with any AWS accounts that do not have all of the Service Control Policies applied. Optionally, an email of this report is sent.

> *NOTE: This Policy Template must be applied to the **AWS Organization Master Payer** account.*

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [more](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)
- *Service Control Policy Names* - The names of the Service Control Policies to check.

## Policy Actions

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy template you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy template. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy template, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy template. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `organizations:ListPolicies`
  - `organizations:ListAccounts`
  - `organizations:ListPoliciesForTarget`

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "organizations:ListPolicies",
                  "organizations:ListAccounts",
                  "organizations:ListPoliciesForTarget"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
