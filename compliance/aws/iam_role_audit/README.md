# AWS IAM Role Audit

## What It Does

This policy checks whether the user-specified AWS IAM roles exist in an account. An incident is raised with a list of all checked roles and whether or not they exist. Optionally, an email is sent with this information.

## How It Works

- The policy leverages the AWS IAM API to check for the existence of IAM Roles.
- If the IAM Roles do not exist, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [More information is available in our documentation.](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)
- *IAM Role Names/IDs/ARNs* - List of IAM role names/IDs/ARNs to check. Any mix of these is permitted, though mixing names/IDs/ARNs may lead to redundant entries in the incident, since a role may match multiple criteria.

## Policy Actions

- Sends an email notification.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

### Credential configuration

For administrators [creating and managing credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) to use with this policy, the following information is needed:

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `sts:GetCallerIdentity`
  - `iam:ListRoles`
  - `iam:ListRoleTags`

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                  "iam:ListRoles",
                  "iam:ListRoleTags"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
