# Azure Policy Audit

## What it does

This policy checks to see if a list of user-specified Azure Policies exist in each Azure Subscription. An incident is raised with a list of all checked Azure Policies and whether or not they exist. Optionally, an email is sent with this information.

## How It Works

- The policy leverages the Azure Resource Manager API to check for assigned policies in all subscriptions the service principal has access to.
- Assigned policies are compared against the list of policies provided.
- An email is sent with details on which policies are assigned and not assigned to each subscription.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Determines whether the Allow/Deny Subscriptions List parameter functions as an allow list (only providing results for the listed subscriptions) or a deny list (providing results for all subscriptions except for the listed subscriptions).
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. If empty, no filtering will occur and recommendations will be produced for all subscriptions.
- *Policy Names* - List of Azure Policy names to check.
