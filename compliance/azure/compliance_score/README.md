# Azure Regulatory Compliance

## What It Does

This Policy Template will provide a report for the various Regulatory Compliance controls and compliance scores for each Azure Subscription. Optionally, the policy will generate an email notification of this report.

## How It Works

- The policy uses the `Microsoft.Security/regulatoryComplianceStandards` endpoint of the Azure Resource Manager API to get a list of all regulatory compliance standards details and state.
- The policy then calculates the compliance score as a percentage with the following formula: `passedControls / (failedControls + skippedControls + passedControls)`

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Determines whether the Allow/Deny Subscriptions List parameter functions as an allow list (only providing results for the listed subscriptions) or a deny list (providing results for all subscriptions except for the listed subscriptions).
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. If empty, no filtering will occur and recommendations will be produced for all subscriptions.
