# Azure Advisor Carbon Reduction Recommendations

## What It Does

This policy template reports Azure carbon reduction recommendations produced by [Azure Advisor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview). Optionally, this report can be emailed.

## How It Works

The policy utilizes the [Azure Advisor API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/advisor/recommendations/list?view=rest-advisor-2023-01-01&tabs=HTTP#category) to get a list of cost recommendations and filters them for ones that contain carbon savings. The specific recommendations produced by Azure Advisor will depend on how it is configured within the Azure environment. Please consult the [relevant Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-get-started) for more information on how to do this.

### Carbon Reduction Details

The policy includes the estimated monthly carbon savings. Savings are measured in kilograms of CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) and are [calculated internally by Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/carbon-optimization/).

## Input Parameters
