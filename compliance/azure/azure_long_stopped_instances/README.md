# Azure Long-Stopped Instances

## What it does

This policy checks all Azure instances that have been stopped for more than a specified period of time and Terminates them after approval.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the Azure API to check all instances that have been stopped for longer than the specified period. If the action is approved, the instance is terminated.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Azure Endpoint* - Azure Endpoint to access resources
- *Subscription Allowed List* - Allowed Subscriptions, if empty, all subscriptions will be checked
- *Stopped days* - Number of days an instance is stopped before it is added to the report
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "*Automatic Actions*" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Terminate Instances" action while applying the policy, all the resources that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be terminated.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Azure Resource Manager Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_109256743_1124668) (*provider=azure_rm*) which has the following permissions:
  - `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read`
  - `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/delete`*

\* Only required for taking action; the policy will still function in a read-only capacity without these permissions.

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
