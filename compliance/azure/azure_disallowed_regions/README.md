# Azure: Disallowed Regions

## What it does

This Policy Template accepts an input that defines which Azure regions are allowed by your compliance policies. Any Azure resource that exists outside of your approved regions will be raised in an Incident. Incidents will escalate to an email notification and will trigger an approval workflow prior to executing Cloud Workflow to delete the resources. If the instance is not able to terminate it will be logged to the CM audit entries.

## Functional Details

- The policy leverages the Azure API to check all resources that exist in a disallowed region.
- When resource in disallowed region is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. Users then have the option to terminate resources after manual approval if needed.
- After approving the terminate action, all the resources may not get deleted due to the dependency.
- So, if you find any error about dependency of the resources, those resources will get deleted in next schedule or you can re-execute the policy.
- If there is any error about supported api-version for any of the resource then you need to manually delete the particular resource.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Approved Azure Region(s)* - list of approved Azure regions
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Azure Endpoint* - Azure Endpoint to access resources
- *Subscription Whitelist* - Whitelisted Subscriptions, if empty, all subscriptions will be checked
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "*Automatic Actions*" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Terminate Instances" action while applying the policy, all the resources that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be terminated.
