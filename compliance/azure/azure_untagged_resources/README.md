# Azure Untagged Resources

## What It Does

This policy template checks for Azure resources missing the user-specified tags. An incident is raised containing the untagged resources, and the user has the option to tag them.

NOTE: This policy is a general policy with only general functionality for finding and repairing broken tags on Azure resources. The [Azure Untagged Virtual Machines](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/tree/master/compliance/azure/azure_untagged_vms/) policy is recommended for use cases focused specifically on untagged virtual machines.

## How It Works

- The policy leverages the Azure API to retrieve a list of all resources in the Azure estate.
- The policy then filters that list based on user-specified parameters.
- The policy then identifies the resources in the filtered list that are missing the tags specified by the user.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy:

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Allow/Deny Resource Types* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Resource Type List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Resource Type List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Resource Type List* - Filter results by resource type, either only allowing this list or denying it depending on how the above parameter is set. Leave blank to consider all the resource types. Resource types should be in the format of `Provider/type`. Example: Microsoft.Compute/disks
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Determines whether the Allow/Deny Subscriptions List parameter functions as an allow list (only providing results for the listed subscriptions) or a deny list (providing results for all subscriptions except for the listed subscriptions).
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. If empty, no filtering will occur and recommendations will be produced for all subscriptions.
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Regions List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Regions List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - Filter results by region, either only allowing this list or denying it depending on how the above parameter is set. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Include Subscription/Resource Group Tags* - Whether or not to include Azure Subscriptions and Resource Groups as resources whose tags are checked and reported on.
- *Tags* - The policy will report resources missing the specified tags. The following formats are supported:
  - `Key` - Find all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key==Value` - Find all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair and all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key!=Value` - Find all resources that have the specified tag key:value pair.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Find all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string and all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Find all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
- *Any / All* - Whether to report on instances missing any of the specified tags or all of them. Only applicable if more than one value is entered in the `Tags` field.
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

This policy has the following input parameters required when adding tags to resources from a raised incident:

- *Add Tags (Key:Value)* - Cloud native tags to add to resources with missing tags. Use Key:Value format. Examples: env:production, team:finance

## Policy Actions

The following policy actions are taken on any resources found to be out of compliance.

- Sends an email notification
- Tag Azure resource after approval

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

### Credential Configuration

For administrators [creating and managing credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) to use with this policy, the following information is needed:

- [**Azure Resource Manager Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_109256743_1124668) (*provider=azure_rm*) which has the following permissions:
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/providers/read`
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resources/read`
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read`
  - `Microsoft.Resources/tags/read`
  - `Microsoft.Resources/tags/write`*

  \* Only required for taking action; the policy will still function in a read-only capacity without these permissions.

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
