## Unapproved instance types
 
### What it does

This policy Report on any instances that are running using instance types that are not approved. \n See the [README](https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/tree/master/compliance/unapproved_instance_types) and [docs.rightscale.com/policies](http://docs.rightscale.com/policies/) to learn more.

### Functional Details
 
The policy leverages the RightScale APIs to check instances across all supported clouds. When a non-approved instance type is detected, a report is emailed and the user can choose to Stop the instance after manual approval.

 
### Input Parameters
 
- *Email addresses to notify* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created
- *Tags to ignore* - List of tags that will exclude Servers from being evaluated by this policy. Multiple tags are evaluated as an 'OR' condition. Tag must be of the format 'namespace:predicate=value'. Example: 'rs_agent:type=right_link_lite,rs_monitoring:state=auth'
- *Approved Instance Types* - List of approved instance types of AWS, Azure and Google cloud, separated by comma. Example: 'a1.medium,a1.large,a1.xlarge,Standard_A0,Standard_A6,f1-micro,n1-highcpu-2 etc..'.
##### Note: You can find Instance Types of all Supported Clouds under 'Policy Data Sets' section of root README.md file(https://github.com/rightscale/policy_templates/blob/master/README.md)

### Resource Names

The report will show the name or the resource_uid of the resource. If the resource doesn't have an name then it will display the resource_uid. For resources that do not have a name, you can follow the resource link and provide name. The next report will have the new resource name.
