# ServiceNow Inactive Approvers

## What It Does

This policy template reports any approval users in ServiceNow that have not approved any request for a user-specified number of days. Optionally, this report can be emailed.

## How It Works

The [ServiceNow Table API](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-api-reference/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_TableAPI.html) is used with appropriate API calls to retrieve information on users and roles and their approval history.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify
- *ServiceNow Instance Name* - Name of the instance in your ServiceNow domain. For example, *myinstance* if your ServiceNow domain is *myinstance.service-now.com*.
- *ServiceNow Roles* - ServiceNow roles assigned to approval users.
- *Approval Action Threshold (Days)* - Number of days without an approval action executed in ServiceNow to report a user.
