# SaaS Manager - Deactivated Users for Integrated Applications

## What It Does

This policy will create an incident when Flexera SaaS Manager identifies integrated SaaS application user accounts that have been deactivated for longer than a user-specified threshold. An incident is raised with a list of these users.

## How It Works

This policy template uses the [SaaS Management API](https://developer.flexera.com/docs/api/saas/v1) to retrieve a list of managed SaaS applications. The policy then obtains a list of integrated applications for each managed SaaS application and their users. The policy then filters for users with a `deactivatedAt` date and calculates the number of days since the user was deactivated.

## Input Parameters

This policy template has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Applications* - A list of parent application names and/or IDs to check for deactivated users. Leave blank to check all applications.
- *Inactive Days Threshold* - Number of days since user was deactivated to include it in the results.
