# Danger
module Danger
  # Handles interacting with git inside a Dangerfile. Providing access to files that have changed, and useful statistics. Also provides
  # access to the commits in the form of [Git::Log](https://github.com/schacon/ruby-git/blob/master/lib/git/log.rb) objects.
  #
  # @example Do something to all new and edited markdown files
  #
  #          markdowns = (git.added_files + git.modified_files)
  #          do_something markdowns.select{ |file| file.end_with? "md" }
  #
  # @example Don't allow a file to be deleted
  #
  #          deleted = git.deleted_files.include? "my/favourite.file"
  #          failure "Don't delete my precious" if deleted
  #
  # @example Fail really big diffs
  #
  #          failure "We cannot handle the scale of this PR" if git.lines_of_code > 50_000
  #
  # @example Warn when there are merge commits in the diff
  #
  #          if git.commits.any? { |c| c.message =~ /^Merge branch 'master'/ }
  #            warn 'Please rebase to get rid of the merge commits in this PR'
  #          end
  #
  # @example Warn when somebody tries to add nokogiri to the project
  #
  #          diff = git.diff_for_file("Gemfile.lock")
  #          if diff && diff.patch =~ "nokogiri"
  #            warn 'Please do not add nokogiri to the project. Thank you.'
