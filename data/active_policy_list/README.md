This JSON file contains a list of all published policies in the catalog and their metadata. This list is generated through automation every time a pull request is merged into the repository.

- [Rakefile](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/blob/master/Rakefile) used for generating this asset.
- [Github Workflow](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-active-policy-list.yaml) to run the above Rakefile when a pull request is merged.
