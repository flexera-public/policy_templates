# AWS Cloud Data

Various AWS-specific data assets, such as pricing data. Some assets are manually maintained and some are generated through automation; see the [Cloud Data Scripts README](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/blob/master/tools/cloud_data/README.md) for more information on how these assets are generated.
