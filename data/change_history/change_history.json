Those policies can be updated as they get touched organically for other reasons.\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [ ] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [ ] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

The following additional changes were also made:\r\n\r\n- Updates some of these scripts and their associated Cloud Workflow to work in the new locations and be less likely to fail.\r\n- The .pip_requirements file was renamed to requirements.txt to satisfy a Python3 need to have such a file present. References to this file have been updated accordingly.\r\n- The pricing scripts were run to both update the associated assets and to ensure they work as expected.\r\n- The AWS EC2 pricing script was modified to rely a bit more on disk space instead of raw memory to complete. \r\n- New workflows were added for all of the existing pricing scripts to ensure they run on a regular weekly cadence.\r\n- README files were added in appropriate places to explain what these assets are for and how they are generated.\r\n  - Additional READMEs were added to similar assets that already existed. \r\n  - Dangerfile was updated to correctly distinguish policy READMEs from other READMEs to avoid nonsensical errors and warnings for the latter.\r\n- The AWS regions asset has been updated.\r\n- Dangerfile was updated to make the textlint test resemble other tests.\r\n\r\n**Note: JSON assets have *not* been moved. Only the scripts that generate them have moved. Policies that rely on these JSON assets should not be impacted by this change.**\r\n\r\n**Note: Broken URLs reported by linting are due to assets that are part of this PR itself. Those URLs will work once this change is merged.**\r\n",

This means a snapshot for a single RDS resource that only appears in the bill once would be returned by the API several times, even though each instance returned by the API was just a version of a single snapshot.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds new logic to account for this. When these iterative snapshots are found, only the most recent one is considered during the analysis instead of all of them. As a result, if someone has a daily backup of an RDS instance, the same instance with the same dollar value in the bill doesn't appear several times in the results, greatly inflating them. This also means that such snapshots will not be reported erroneously simply because their oldest iteration is > 30 days.\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=66047e637566c288f2dac424\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [ ] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

The following changes were made:\r\n- Updated permissions across the board to match our current documentation.\r\n- Removed: Idle Compute policy since this policy is deprecated. \r\n- Removed: Unused RDS policy since this policy is deprecated. \r\n- Added: Rightsize RDS Instances\r\n- Added: Rightsize EBS Volumes\r\n- Added: Superseded Instances\r\n- Added: Unused Classic Load Balancers (CLBs)\r\n\r\nDuring review for this, a typo was discovered in the permissions for the AWS Tag Cardinality Report README. This has been fixed, as well as all other linting errors for this file.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nThis is the result of running this CFT, selecting for actions when possible, in our sales-sandbox account:\r\n\r\nhttps://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/roles/details/TestRole908734205?section=permissions\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n",

Warning because false positives are likely but should be minimal\r\n- New test: Raise error if there are orphaned code blocks e.g. code blocks that are not referenced or used elsewhere in the policy.\r\n- Updated test: Important Files Modified test is now a single consolidated warning to save space and be more readable.\r\n\r\nDangefile fixes:\r\n- Fix: README permission test no longer incorrectly expects presence of cloud-specific credentials simply because the name of the policy references that cloud. We have a handful of cloud-specific policies that only need a Flexera credential.\r\n  - A new policy test has been added to compare the credentials in the policy itself to the ones in the README instead.\r\n- Fix: CHANGELOG formatting test no longer incorrectly reports indented secondary lists as a problem.\r\n- Fix: Warning about missing READY-TO-REVIEW label changed from warning to message, since adding this label does not retrigger Dangerfile and remove the warning.\r\n\r\nRakefile improvements:\r\n- Rakefile now obtains Github credential via the ENV keyword rather than a bash echo command. This should be more secure.\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.",

      "description": "This PR evolved into a behemoth due to changes requiring further changes to facilitate them. This PR does the following:\r\n\r\n### Billing Center Access Report Policy Revamp\r\n\r\nFrom the CHANGELOG:\r\n\r\n- Billing Center filter condensed to a single parameter and now supports both names and IDs\r\n- Incident summary is now derived from the name of the applied policy\r\n- Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution\r\n\r\nExample Applied Policy: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/28010/automation/applied-policies/projects/123559?policyId=65fb2c113ad5094c4696143c\r\n\r\n### Dangerfile short_description Link Test\r\n\r\nThe Dangerfile now checks for invalid URLs in the `short_description` of a policy and raises an error if the link doesn't match the location of the file.\r\n\r\n### Invalid short_description Link Fixes\r\n\r\nBy running a local version of the above test, I found several existing policies with bad URLs in their `short_description`. These have been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Github Repository Reorganization\r\n\r\nThe repository has been reorganized so that Flexera policies are in their own subdirectories based on the specific product they apply to. For example, `compliance/flexera/automation`, `cost/flexera/cco`, `operational/flexera/cmp`, etc. This makes the repository much less cluttered and much easier to find things in. MSP policies also have been moved accordingly into the appropriate `flexera/msp` directories.\r\n\r\nThe meta policy and permissions generator files have been updated to account for the new file paths.\r\n\r\n### Explicit Publish False\r\n\r\nAll policies that are currently unpublished due to special rules in the Rakefile have been updated to contain an explicit `publish: false` in their metadata. This means we can get rid of these special rules and have a consistent implementation.\r\n\r\n### Rakefile Update: `updated_at` and `recommendation_type` fields added\r\n\r\nThe Rakefile used for generating the active policy list has been updated to include two new fields. `updated_at` is an ISO-8601 datetime string indicating when the policy was last modified in the catalog. `recommendation_type` is the requivalent field from the policy's info metadata block if such a value is specified.\r\n\r\nThe Rakefile also no longer ignores policies based on location or metadata other than the `publish` field in the info block. Policies should always have this field set to false if we don't want them to be published, and this same PR updates the relevant policies to ensure that this is the case.\r\n\r\n### Gemfile Update: octokit\r\n\r\n`Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` have been updated to include the octokit gem. This is what enables the Rakefile to obtain metadata from Github, such as when a policy was last updated.\r\n\r\n### Manual Workflow Updates\r\n\r\nThe `Test Policies` and `Update Active Policy List` workflows have been updated to allow for manual execution to assist in testing changes.\r\n\r\n### Defunct File Removal\r\n\r\nA handful of ancient defunct files from the RightScale days have been removed.\r\n",

This is where those are.\r\n- **Github Pull Request Testing**: Run tests specific to Github and pull requests.\r\n- **All Files Testing**: Run tests that apply to all changed files. Currently only used for text linting.\r\n- **README Contents Testing**: Run tests that apply to all changed policy README files.\r\n- **CHANGELOG Contents Testing**: Run tests that apply to all changed policy CHANGELOG files.\r\n- **Misc.

To prevent future regressions, I have gone through all Azure policies to ensure that only the correct datasources with the proper ignore_status functionality will exist in the catalog after this update.\r\n\r\nI also did the same with a couple of minor, non-material changes to spacing to ensure consistency. In cases where this was the only change made, I did not bother iterating the version number or updating the changelog because these changes do not affect policy execution whatsoever.

      "description": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is for several related things:\r\n\r\n- `/data/azure/tag-support.csv` has been replaced with `/data/azure/resource_types.json` due to JSON being natively supported by the policy engine. It also contains information unrelated to tag support, so this new naming is more accurate and will allow for the file to be extended with more resource type related metadata if ever needed. The below `Azure Untagged Resources` policy is the only policy currently making use of this file, so this change should have no impact on other policies.\r\n\r\n- `Azure Untagged Resources` policy has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. Core functionality is the same, but new filtering features were added. From the CHANGELOG:\r\n  - Added ability to filter resources by tag key, tag key==value, or using regex\r\n  - Added ability to filter resources by region\r\n  - Added ability to filter resources by Azure resource type\r\n  - Added ability to use all filters as an allow list or a deny list\r\n  - Added additional context to incident description\r\n  - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution\r\n  - Policy now requires a valid Flexera One credential\r\n \r\n- `Azure Untagged Virtual Machines`: This is a new policy that only checks tags for virtual machines, but due to this narrowed focus, has more functionality than the `Azure Untagged Resources` policy. The incident reports on additional VM-specific metadata, and the policy allows for powering off or deleting instances in addition to tagging them.\r\n\r\n- The above policies now support a variety of conditionals as well as regex. Note that, while I have intentionally not documented this since it is not \"to spec\", using a single = will also work in order to account for user error when entering in values. From the READMEs:\r\n  - *Tags* - The policy will report resources missing the specified tags. The following formats are supported:\r\n    - `Key` - Find all resources missing the specified tag key.\r\n    - `Key==Value` - Find all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair and all resources missing the specified tag key.\r\n    - `Key!=Value` - Find all resources that have the specified tag key:value pair.\r\n    - `Key=~/Regex/` - Find all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string and all resources missing the specified tag key.\r\n    - `Key!~/Regex/` - Find all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=658c560e9f8a200001ecbc27\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=658c559e7cc18300018b402d\r\n\r\nNote: Azure Untagged Resources policy has been slightly modified from this PR for testing in order to use the `/data/azure/resource_types.json` file in this branch since it won't exist in the master branch until after this PR is merged.\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

The policy should now work with both old and new connections and collect costs from both if both are present.\r\n\r\nI've done a pretty thorough investigation/testing of this in a client account, and I am confident that we are now pulling the correct data.\r\n\r\nIt's likely that this policy will be changed to use the savings value in Optima once that feature is available for Azure, but this PR will ensure the policy at least continues to work as expected for users using the new EA bill connections in the meantime.\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/27018/automation/applied-policies/projects/116186?policyId=65426cfb99745e0001587dfe\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [ ] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

Specifically, the date range we pull data for is now rounded down to the nearest hour. This is to ensure that the range is neatly sliced by the period we specify so that we only get one result back from CloudWatch for each metric.\r\n\r\nPreviously, it would sometimes imperfectly slice the data, giving us two results, the first being for less than an hour of time and the second being the number we actually needed, but when this happened, the policy grabbed the first number instead. As a backup, just in case somehow the above doesn't work, the policy now grabs the last item in the list of values instead of just grabbing [0] every time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I spotted a couple of issues where the lookback period was not being correctly used to adjust our request to the amount of days the user specified. Those have been fixed as well.\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/27018/automation/applied-policies/projects/116186?policyId=653bb85099745e0001587d81\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [ ] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

Previously, all possible combinations of instances were obtained, obtaining a cost for each combination of instance_type and region (for example, if we have 100 different instances_type and 15 regions, we would obtain 1500 average costs, even though many were not necessary according to the records obtained from the API). By adding the 5 new dimensions, this approach becomes impractical, since it would increase exponentially for each combination of operating system, database engine, database edition, etc.\r\n\r\nSo it was decided to use a map with a key composed of\r\n` instance_type---region---operating_system---database_engine---database_edition---license_model---deployment_option`\r\nto filter the cost records obtained from the API that match that combination, to subsequently calculate the average cost per hour of the records with purchase_option = \"On demand\" and thus calculate the estimated savings of the records of the other purchase_option (Reserved, Savings Plan, Spot)\r\n\r\n### Issues Resolved\r\n\r\nhttps://flexera.atlassian.net/browse/FOPTS-1503\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\n[Applied Policy](https://app.flexera.com/orgs/1105/automation/applied-policies/projects/60073?policyId=651b7ebe66636500010089eb)\r\n<!-- This can be helpful for a reviewer to validate the changes proposed resulted in the expected behavior.

The most notable change is that the policy will now convert the savings reported by Google to the Flexera org's currency when appropriate.\r\n\r\nFrom the CHANGELOG:\r\n\r\n- Policy now requires a Flexera credential\r\n- Policy now converts savings to local currency when appropriate\r\n- Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable\r\n- Removed deprecated \"Log to CM Audit Entries\" parameter\r\n- Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold\r\n- Added ability to filter resources by project and by region via an allow list or a deny list\r\n- Added ability to filter resources by multiple label key:value pairs\r\n- Added additional context to incident description\r\n- Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies\r\n- Added additional fields to incident export to facilitate scraping for dashboards\r\n- Policy no longer raises new escalations if savings data changed but nothing else has\r\n- Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution\r\n- Added logic required for \"Meta Policy\" use-cases\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this pull request also contains changes to our scripting for generating meta policies so that they can be generated for Google policies in a style very similar to what is done for Azure. \r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nWhile we do have a test environment for GCP, recommendations can take some time to actually be generated. I have tested this policy in a client environment and verified it works as expected and can provide the incident it produced upon request.\r\n\r\nAn example of the policy running in a test environment without error, but not raising an incident, can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=65171b69ac11110001c8ed3d\r\n\r\n(I have also tested the CWF by modifying the policy temporarily to report on IP addresses that have no recommendations. The delete action works as expected)\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

      "description": "### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a revamp of the Azure Rightsize SQL Databases policy as part of the general audit on usage and rate reduction policies. In order to have parity with the Azure Rightsize Compute policy, and to avoid duplicate recommendations, this policy now reports on both unused and underutilized SQL databases via distinct incidents. A parameter allows the user, if desired, to report on only unused or only underutilized instances, retaining existing functionality.\r\n\r\nThe policy now also offers savings estimates for rightsizing opportunities. For underutilized resources, the cost of the instance is divided by the current capacity of the instance and then multiplied by the recommended capacity of the instance to determine the new cost if the instance were downsized. This is then subtracted from the current cost of the resource to determine the savings. This works because pricing for Azure SQL databases is straightforwardly a multiple of the capacity assigned to it within a given tier. For example, a Standard instance with a capacity of 50 costs 5x what a Standard instance with a capacity of 10 costs. \r\n\r\nFrom the CHANGELOG:\r\n\r\n- Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable\r\n- Removed deprecated \"Log to CM Audit Entries\" parameter\r\n- Added potential savings to recommendations\r\n- Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold\r\n- Added incident for unused instances based on lack of connections\r\n- Added ability to delete unused instances\r\n- Added ability to configure how many days back to consider when determining if instance is unused or underutilized\r\n- Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs\r\n- Added ability to filter resources by region\r\n- Added additional context to incident description\r\n- Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies\r\n- Added human-readable recommendation to incident export\r\n- Policy no longer raises new escalations if statistics or savings data changed but nothing else has\r\n- Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=650069e66a972a0001e4fae6\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=65006a676a972a0001e4fae8\r\n\r\nNote: Both downsize and delete actions have been tested successfully. Cost data has been confirmed to work as well, but this data is not meaningfully available in our Flexera Services test account. CPU average data is also working but reports as 0 in the incident because the average CPU usage for this instance is 0.004032258064516129, which rounds down to 0 when reducing it to 2 decimal points. This can be confirmed by viewing the applied policy log.\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

The changes to this policy are roughly analogous to the changes made to the AWS version, using the same code and verbiage where appropriate. From the CHANGELOG:\r\n\r\n- Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable\r\n- Removed deprecated \"Log to CM Audit Entries\" parameter\r\n- Removed ability to filter by how long a policy was detached; see README* for more details\r\n- Added ability to filter by volume age\r\n- Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold\r\n- Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs\r\n- Added additional context to incident description\r\n- Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies\r\n- Added human-readable recommendation to incident export\r\n- Policy no longer raises new escalations if ages or savings data changed but nothing else has\r\n- Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution\r\n\r\nFrom the README:\r\n\r\nNote: Previous versions of this policy had the option to filter results by how long a volume was detached. This functionality did not work as expected due to Azure volume logs not recording detachment events. Such events are recorded in the logs of the VM the volume was detached from, and there is currently no way to determine the most recently attached VM for a volume through Azure's APIs. For this reason, this functionality was removed.\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nhttps://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64f1e85e2d830e000134f7ec\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

The child policies have also been updated to include support for metapolicies.\r\n\r\n**Breaking changes** are made to many of these policies to get them to conform with what the meta policy script expects. This mostly involves changing the name of *param_subscription_allowed_list* parameter to *param_subscriptions_list* and changing the name of the Azure credential block from *azure_auth* to *auth_azure*. In a small number of policies, a Flexera credential was added that did not exist previously.\r\n\r\nNote: Warnings about Azure meta parent policies lacking READMEs can safely be ignored.\r\n\r\n### Issues Resolved\r\n\r\nA handful of issues were fixed in the child policies that were discovered during this process. The details are included in the CHANGELOG files.\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nBelow are child policies just to show that the child policy updates did not break the policies.\r\nThe meta parent policies can't be easily tested until after this merge is complete, but the risk here is low since those are not published in the catalog anyway.\r\n\r\n- Idle Compute Instances: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b54ab01c05c900018b230e\r\n- Old Snapshots: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b530de126883000167896e\r\n- Rightsize Compute Instances: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b532911c05c900018b21e4\r\n- Rightsize SQL Databases: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b5312b126883000167896f\r\n- Unused SQL Databases: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b5316d1c05c900018b21e2\r\n- Unused IP Addresses: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64beba3c1c05c900018b32e8\r\n- Unused Volumes: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b5319b1c05c900018b21e3\r\n- Hybrid Use Benefit (Windows): https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b548fe1c05c900018b230b\r\n- Hybrid Use Benefit (Linux): https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b549161c05c900018b230c\r\n- Hybrid Use Benefit (SQL): https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b5493e1c05c900018b230d\r\n- Storage Lifecycle Management: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b540d01268830001678a57\r\n- Expiring Azure Certificates: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b82c5d1268830001678e0b\r\n- Azure Long Running Instances: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b82c751268830001678e0c\r\n- Azure Tag Cardinality Report: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b82c911268830001678e0d\r\n- Azure VMs Not Using Managed Disks: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b82d721268830001678e21\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

This was caused by relying on timeModified instead of timeCreated when determining which objects to send into CBI.\r\n\r\n- Added option to run for previous month along with relevant parameter. The README was also updated to recommend that users apply the policy twice, once for the current month and once for the previous month, to ensure that any changes made to the bill after the month ends (a common thing for cloud providers) are incorporated into the platform.\r\n\r\n- Added regex to ensure that user-specified billing periods are valid. Self-explanatory why this would be a good thing.\r\n\r\n- General code cleanup and modernization. In particular, some code was refactored to make more effective use of underscore.js, datasources were paired with their respective scripts instead of having a distinct section in the policy for each, and comments were added to explain the branching logic of the policy.\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\nWe do not have a shared test environment where I can link to an applied policy, but I can confirm that I have tested this new policy with a customer (Banco de Chile) and it works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Contribution Check List\r\n\r\n- [X] New functionality includes testing.\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable\r\n- [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD\r\n",

Actual functionality is unchanged from the original policy, but the code now follows our current standards in terms of naming conventions, organization, and readability.\r\n\r\n### Issues Resolved\r\n\r\n<!-- List any existing issues this PR resolves below -->\r\nCode now conforms to our expectations.\r\n\r\n### Link to Example Applied Policy\r\n\r\n<!-- URL to the Applied Policy that was used for dev/testing below -->\r\n<!-- This can be helpful for a reviewer to validate the changes proposed resulted in the expected behavior.

A new field to the export statement, Status, was added to show the volume's current status.\r\n\r\nAppropriate CWF code was added to ensure that attached volumes are detached before being deleted (and this has been tested; poor vol-0dc3f4692c6a6d88d never saw it coming). Detaching happens before both snapshot and deletion.\r\n\r\nI also cleaned up some of the policy code to modernize it and improve readability. Basic functionality is unchanged apart from the above.\r\n\r\nFinally, the CWF template was modified to add DetachVolume to the permissions for this policy, since that is now needed for full functionality.\r\n\r\n### Issues Resolved\r\n\r\n<!-- List any existing issues this PR resolves below -->\r\nN/A.

Those can probably be done by hand or using mass search and replace in an editor or something as they're more rote\r\n* This just gets you roughly there and tries to do the tedious and error prone parts for you, not meant to be super thorough or perfect. Lots of the more complicated tables didn't convert super well, I've left comments as needed with clarifications. Leave comments if you have any questions on that PR, will leave it open as a reference for a little bit.\r\n\r\nI made a temporary PR with a run of the tool just for discussion purposes, no need to merge it.
