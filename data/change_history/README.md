# Change History

This JSON file contains a list of all pull requests merged into the repository with the exception of pull requests to update this file. This list is automatically updated every time a pull request is merged. A separate human-readable list of just updates to policies is also generated.

- [Script](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/blob/master/tools/change_history/) used for generating this asset and the [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/blob/master/HISTORY.md) file.
- [Github Workflow](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-change-history.yaml) to run the above script when a pull request is merged.
- [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/blob/master/HISTORY.md) file containing a human-readable list of the merges that specifically impact policies.
