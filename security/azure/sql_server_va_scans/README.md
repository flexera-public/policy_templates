# Azure Ensure SQL Server VA Periodic Scans Enabled

## What it does

This policy checks all Azure SQL Servers to ensure that they have Vulnerability Assessment periodic scans enabled. An incident is raised with the offending SQL Servers if any are found that don't.

## Functional Details

The Azure Resource Manager API is used to get a list of subscriptions and SQL Servers within those subscriptions. The policy then queries the Vulnerability Assessments endpoint for each SQL Server and checks the "properties.recurringScans.isEnabled" field to ensure periodic scans are enabled.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Allow or Deny entered Subscriptions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Allow or Deny entered regions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - A list of allowed or denied regions. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.

  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.
  - `Key==Value` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key:value pair.
  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
