# Azure Subscriptions Without High Severity Alerts

## What It Does

This policy template reports all Azure subscriptions that are not configured to send out high severity alerts. Optionally, this report can be emailed.

## How It Works

The Azure Resource Manager API is used to get a list of subscriptions. This list is then used to query the "/providers/Microsoft.Security/securityContacts" endpoint iteratively in order to find the properties.alertNotifications.minimalSeverity and properties.alertNotifications.state settings for each subscription.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Allow or Deny entered Subscriptions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
