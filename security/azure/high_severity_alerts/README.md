# Azure Subscriptions Without High Severity Alerts

## What It Does

This policy template reports all Azure subscriptions that are not configured to send out high severity alerts. Optionally, this report can be emailed.

## How It Works

An Azure Subscription is considered to have high severity alerts enabled if its default security contact has a notification source where `minimalSeverity` is "High" and `sourceType` is "Alert".

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Allow or Deny entered Subscriptions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
- *Attach CSV To Incident Email* - Whether or not to attach the results as a CSV file to the incident email.
- *Incident Table Rows for Email Body (#)* - The number of results to include in the incident table in the incident email. Set to '0' to not show an incident table at all, and '100000' to include all results. Does not impact attached CSV files or the incident as presented in Flexera One.
