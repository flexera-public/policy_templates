# AWS Unencrypted ELB Listeners (ALB/NLB)

## What it does

Checks for unecrypted listeners on Application and Network Load Balancers. If an internet-facing listener is using an unecrypted protocol (eg: NOT HTTPS, SSL, or TLS) an incident report will show for the listener and an email will be sent to the user-specified email address.

Note: Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) supports three types of load balancers: Classic Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, and Network Load Balancers. There is a separate policy for Classic Load Balancers with unencrypted internet-facing listeners.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS elasticloadbalancing API to examine listener details. When an unencrypted internet-facing listener is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Ignore tags* - ALB/NLB with any of these tags will be ignored

## Policy Actions

- Send an email report
