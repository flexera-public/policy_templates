# AWS IAM Ensure Credentials Unused For >45 days Are Disabled

## What it does

Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. AWS users need their own access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Tools for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using the APIs for individual AWS services. It is recommended that all access keys be rotated every 90 days or less, and this policy will trigger an incident if access keys exist that are older than 90 days.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS IAM API to generate and examine a credential report. When access keys are found that are 90 days or older, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. This email report contains a list of affected user accounts.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify

## Policy Actions

- Send an email report
