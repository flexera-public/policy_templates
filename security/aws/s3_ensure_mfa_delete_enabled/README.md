# AWS Ensure MFA Delete Enabled For S3 Buckets

## What it does

Adding MFA Delete to an S3 bucket requires additional authentication when you change the version state of your bucket or you delete an object version, adding another layer of security in the event your security credentials are compromised or unauthorized access is granted. This policy will raise an incident if any S3 Buckets are found on the account without MFA Delete enabled.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS S3 API to gather a list of S3 buckets on the account, their details, and whether they have MFA Delete enabled. When one or more S3 buckets are found without MDA Delete enabled, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. This email report contains a list of affected S3 buckets.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
