# AWS S3 Ensure 'Block Public Access' Configured For All Buckets

## What it does

By default, S3 buckets and objects are created with public access disabled. However, an IAM principal with sufficient S3 permissions can enable public access at the bucket and/or object level. While enabled, 'Block Public Access' prevents an individual bucket, and its contained objects, from becoming publicly accessible. This policy will raise an incident if any S3 Buckets are found on the account without 'Block Public Access' enabled.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS S3 API to gather a list of S3 buckets on the account, their details, and whether they have 'Block Public Access' enabled. To meet this requirement, all four boolean values in the Public Access Block (BlockPublicAcls, IgnorePublicAcls, BlockPublicPolicy, and RestrictPublicBuckets) need to be 'TRUE'. When one or more S3 buckets are found with one or more of these values set to 'FALSE', an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. This email report contains a list of affected S3 buckets along with these values for each one.
