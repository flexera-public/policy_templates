# AWS Ensure Object-level Events Logging Enabled For CloudTrails

## What it does

S3 object-level API operations such as GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject are called data events. By default, CloudTrail trails don't log data events and so it is recommended to enable Object-level logging for S3 buckets. This policy raises an incident if any CloudTrails are not configured to do so.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS CloudTrail API.

## Input Parameters
