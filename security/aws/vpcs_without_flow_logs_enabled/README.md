# AWS VPC's without FlowLogs Enabled

## What it does

Checks for whether a VPC has flow logs enabled or not. It will report on vpcs without flow logs enabled.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS ec2 API to examine vpc and flowlog details. When a vpc without flowlogs enabled is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed Regions* - A list of allowed regions for an AWS account. Please enter the allowed regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
