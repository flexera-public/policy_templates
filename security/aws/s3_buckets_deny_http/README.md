# AWS S3 Ensure Bucket Policies Deny HTTP Requests

## What it does

By default, Amazon S3 allows both HTTP and HTTPS requests. In order to only allow HTTPS requests, HTTP requests must be explicitly denied via a bucket policy. This policy will raise an incident if any S3 Buckets are found on the account without policies that explicitly deny HTTP requests.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS S3 API to gather a list of S3 buckets on the account, their details, and whether they have policies that deny HTTP requests. When one or more S3 buckets are found either without any policy or with a policy that does not deny HTTP requests, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. This email report contains a list of affected S3 buckets along with whether the bucket has no policy at all or a policy that does not deny HTTP requests.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
