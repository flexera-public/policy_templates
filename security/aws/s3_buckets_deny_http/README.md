# AWS S3 Buckets Accepting HTTP Requests

## What It Does

This policy template reports any AWS S3 buckets that lack a policy to block HTTP requests. Optionally, it emails this report.

By default, Amazon S3 allows both HTTP and HTTPS requests, but HTTP requests lack encryption and are not recommended. In order to only allow HTTPS requests, HTTP requests must be explicitly denied via a bucket policy.

## How It Works

Any S3 bucket without a policy statement that meets the following criteria will be included in the report:

- **Resource:** arn:aws:s3:::`{bucket name}`/*
- **Condition:** Bool aws:SecureTransport == false
- **Action:** s3:GetObject
- **Effect:** Deny

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [More information is available in our documentation.](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)

## Policy Actions

- Sends an email notification.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `sts:GetCallerIdentity`
  - `s3:ListBuckets`
  - `s3:GetBucketLocation`
  - `s3:GetBucketPolicy`

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                  "s3:ListBuckets",
                  "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                  "s3:GetBucketPolicy"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
