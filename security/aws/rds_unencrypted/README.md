# AWS Unencrypted RDS Instances

## What it does

This policy checks all Relational Database Service (RDS) instances and reports on any that are unencrypted. When such a RDS instance is detected, the user can optionally delete them.

## Functional Details

When a Unencrypted RDS instance is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. Users then have the option to delete the RDS instance after manual approval if needed.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed/Denied Regions* - Whether to treat regions parameter as allow or deny list.
- *Regions* - A list of regions to allow or deny for an AWS account. Please enter the regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [more](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)
- *Ignore tags* - RDS instances with any of these tags will be ignored
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Delete RDS Instances" action while applying the policy, all the resources that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be deleted.

## Policy Actions

- Send an email report
- RDS instances with 'DB Instance Status' other than 'Available' and RDS instances with 'Delete Protection Enabled' cannot be deleted.
- When delete action is performed, DB snapshot gets created with name '<--RDS Instance Name-->-finalSnapshot' Ex mySQL-DBinstance-finalSnapshot before deleting DB instance.
- For Aurora instance, policy creates cluster snapshot since DB instance snapshot cannot be created directly.
