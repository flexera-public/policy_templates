# AWS Ensure EBS Encryption By Default

## What it does

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) supports encryption at rest when using the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service. It is possible and recommended to enable this by default for new EBS volumes for every active region. This policy checks the specified regions and raises an incident if any of them are not configured to encrypt new EBS volumes by default.

## Functional Details

When one or more of the provided regions does not have ebsEncryptionByDefault set to "true", this policy raises an incident with a list of the affected regions.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed Regions* - A list of allowed regions for an AWS account. Please enter the allowed regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
