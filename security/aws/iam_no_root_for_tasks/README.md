# AWS No Root User For Everyday Tasks

## What it does

With the creation of an AWS account, a 'root user' is created that cannot be disabled or deleted. That user has unrestricted access to and control over all resources in the AWS account. It is highly recommended that the use of this account be avoided for everyday tasks, and this policy checks if the root user has been used in the last 7 days.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS IAM API to generate and examine a credential report. When the root user has accessed the account either via a password or an access key in the last 7 days, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
