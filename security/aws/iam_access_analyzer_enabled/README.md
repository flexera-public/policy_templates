# AWS Access Analyzers Enabled

## What it does

Access Analyzer scans show resources that other accounts and federated users can access, such as KMS keys and IAM roles. So the results allow you to determine if an unintended user is allowed, making it easier for administrators to monitor least privileges access. This policy ensures that Access Analyzers are enabled for the specified regions.

## Functional Details

When one or more of the provided regions does not have an access analyzer enabled, this policy raises an incident with a list of the affected regions.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed/Denied Regions* - Whether to treat regions parameter as allow or deny list.
- *Regions* - A list of regions to allow or deny for an AWS account. Please enter the regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
