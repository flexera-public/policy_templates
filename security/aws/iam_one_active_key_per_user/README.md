# AWS Ensure One Active Key Per IAM User

## What it does

This policy checks all of the IAM users on an AWS account to ensure none of them have more than one active access key. If any users do, an incident is raised.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS IAM API to obtain a list of users and their access keys. A count is produced of how many active keys each user has, and an incident is raised if any users have more than one active key. An email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. This email report contains a list of affected users.

## Input Parameters
