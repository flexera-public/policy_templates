# AWS Unencrypted ELB Listeners (CLB)

## What it does

Checks for unecrypted listeners on Classic Load Balancers. If an internet-facing listener is using an unecrypted protocol (eg: NOT HTTPS, SSL, or TLS) an incident report will show for the listener and an email will be sent to the user-specified email address.

Note: Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) supports three types of load balancers: Classic Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, and Network Load Balancers. There is a separate policy for Application and Network Load Balancers with unencrypted internet-facing listeners.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS elasticloadbalancing API to examine listener details. When an unencrypted internet-facing listener is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed Regions* - A list of allowed regions for an AWS account. Please enter the allowed regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
