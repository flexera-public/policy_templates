# AWS IAM Ensure Credentials Unused For >45 days Are Disabled

## What it does

AWS IAM users can access AWS resources using different types of credentials, such as passwords or access keys. It is recommended that all credentials that have been unused in 45 or greater days be deactivated or removed, and this policy checks for unused credentials.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS IAM API to generate and examine a credential report. When user credentials are found that have not been used for 45 days or longer, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. This email report contains a list of affected user accounts.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
