# AWS CloudTrail S3 Buckets Without Access Logging

## What It Does

This policy template reports any CloudTrail S3 buckets in the AWS account that do not have access logging enabled. Optionally, this report can be emailed.

S3 Bucket Access Logging generates a log that contains access records for each request made to your S3 bucket. An access log record contains details about the request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request worked, and the time and date the request was processed. It is recommended that this logging be enabled for all CloudTrail S3 buckets to provide an audit trail.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [More information is available in our documentation.](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `sts:GetCallerIdentity`
  - `cloudtrail:DescribeTrails`
  - `s3:GetBucketLocation`
  - `s3:GetBucketLogging`

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                  "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails",
                  "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                  "s3:GetBucketLogging"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
