# AWS Ensure AWS Config Enabled In All Regions

## What it does

This policy verifies that AWS Config is enabled and properly configured for all active regions.

## Functional Details

The AWS Config API is used to gather the AWS Config information for all regions. When a region is found that has no AWS Config settings, or the AWS Config recordingGroup has 'allSupported' or 'includeGlobalResourceTypes' set to 'false', that region and these settings are added to a list. An incident is raised if this list contains any regions.
