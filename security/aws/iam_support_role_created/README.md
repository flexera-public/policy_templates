# AWS Ensure Support Role Created And Attached

## What it does

AWS provides a support center that can be used for incident notification and response, as well as technical support and customer services. This policy verifies that an IAM Role to allow authorized users to manage incidents with AWS Support exists.

## Functional Details

When the AWSSupportAccess IAM policy is not attached to a role, this policy raises an incident.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
