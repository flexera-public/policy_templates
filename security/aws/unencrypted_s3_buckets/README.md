# AWS Unencrypted S3 Buckets

## What it does

This policy checks all S3 buckets in the AWS account and reports on any that do not have default encryption set. When an unencrypted S3 bucket is detected, the user can choose to enable default encryption (AES-256) after approval and the user can also choose to delete the unencrypted S3 Buckets by enabling 'delete action' as mentioned in Enable delete action section below after approval.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS API to determine the encryption settings for each S3 bucket.

When an unencrypted bucket is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. Users then have an option to modify configuration after manual approval, and even Users can perform delete action if required.

encrypt - modifies the configuration of the unencrypted S3 Bucket by enabling the Default encryption i.e. AES-256

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses to notify* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created
- *Tags to ignore* - List of tags that will exclude resources from being evaluated by this policy. Multiple tags are evaluated as an 'OR' condition. Tag keys or key/value pairs can be listed. Example: 'test,env=dev'
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Encrypt Buckets" action while applying the policy, all the buckets that are not encrypted  will be encrypted.
