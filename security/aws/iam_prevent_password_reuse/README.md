# AWS Restrict Reusing Passwords

## What it does

IAM password policies can prevent the reuse of a given password by the same user. It is recommended that the password policy prevent the reuse of passwords, and this policy checks if the password policy has been configured to disallow reusing passwords and to store at least 24 previous passwords for ensuring this.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS IAM API to examine the password policy. When there is no password policy, the policy does not restrict reusing passwords, or the policy stores fewer than 24 previous passwords, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
