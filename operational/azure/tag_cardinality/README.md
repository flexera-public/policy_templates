# Azure Tag Cardinality Report

## What It Does

This Policy Template is used to generate a tag cardinality (how many unique values each tag key has) report for Azure, along with a list of those unique values for each tag key. The report includes cardinality for all tag values for Azure Subscriptions, Resource Groups, and Resources.

## How It Works

This policy performs the following action:

- Connect to the Azure Resource Manager API to get a list of Azure Subscriptions, Resource Groups, and Resources, along with their tags.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameter required when launching the policy.

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Determines whether the Allow/Deny Subscriptions List parameter functions as an allow list (only providing results for the listed subscriptions) or a deny list (providing results for all subscriptions except for the listed subscriptions).
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. If empty, no filtering will occur and recommendations will be produced for all subscriptions.
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Regions List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Regions List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - Filter results by region, either only allowing this list or denying it depending on how the above parameter is set. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
