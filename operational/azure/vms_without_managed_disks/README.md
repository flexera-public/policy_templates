# Azure VMs Not Using Managed Disks

## What It Does

This policy checks all Azure virtual machines and reports on any that are not making use of [Managed Disks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview). Optionally, a report listing the non-compliant virtual machines is emailed.

## How It Works

- The Azure Resource Manager API is used to retrieve a list of all virtual machines and their metadata.
- This list is then filtered to just those virtual machines that have a value for `properties.storageProfile.osDisk.vhd`; this indicates that the virtual machine is *not* using Managed Disks.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Determines whether the Allow/Deny Subscriptions List parameter functions as an allow list (only providing results for the listed subscriptions) or a deny list (providing results for all subscriptions except for the listed subscriptions).
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. If empty, no filtering will occur and recommendations will be produced for all subscriptions.
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Regions List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Regions List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - Filter results by region, either only allowing this list or denying it depending on how the above parameter is set. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Exclusion Tags* - The policy will filter resources containing the specified tags from the results. The following formats are supported:
  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.
  - `Key==Value` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key:value pair.
  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
- *Exclusion Tags: Any / All* - Whether to filter instances containing any of the specified tags or only those that contain all of them. Only applicable if more than one value is entered in the `Exclusion Tags` field.
