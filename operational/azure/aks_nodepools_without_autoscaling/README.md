# AKS Node Pools Without Autoscaling

## What it does

This policy will raise an incident if there are any AKS clusters with user node pools that do not have autoscaling enabled.

## Functional Details

This policy checks all the user node pools associated with each AKS cluster. If the 'enableAutoScaling' value for a node pool is set to 'false', that node pool is added to the list of problematic pools, and an incident is raised if this list contains any items.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.

  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
