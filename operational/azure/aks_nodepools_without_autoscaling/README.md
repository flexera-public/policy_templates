# AKS Node Pools Without Autoscaling

## What It Does

This policy will raise an incident if there are any AKS clusters with user node pools that do not have autoscaling enabled.

## How It Works

This policy template checks all the user node pools associated with each AKS cluster. If the 'enableAutoScaling' value for a node pool is set to 'false', that node pool is added to the list of problematic pools, and an incident is raised if this list contains any items.

## Input Parameters

- *Exclusion Tags* - The policy will filter resources containing the specified tags from the results. The following formats are supported:
  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.

  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
- *Exclusion Tags: Any / All* - Whether to filter instances containing any of the specified tags or only those that contain all of them. Only applicable if more than one value is entered in the `Exclusion Tags` field.
