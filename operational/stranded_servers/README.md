## Stranded Servers
 
### What it does

This policy checks all Servers in Cloud Management and reports on any that have stranded during the boot process. It provides the option to terminate any stranded servers after approval.

### Functional Details
 
The policy leverages Cloud Management APIs to identify servers that have not successfully completed their boot sequence (i.e. have "stranded in booting"). Servers can optionally be terminated after approval.

Note: Locked instances will not be terminated.
 
### Input Parameters
 
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Ignore tags* - Instances with any of these tags will be ignored 
 
### Resource Names

The report will show the name or the resource_uid of the resource. If the resource doesn't have an name then it will display the resource_uid. For resources that do not have a name, you can follow the resource link and provide name. The next report will have the new resource name.
