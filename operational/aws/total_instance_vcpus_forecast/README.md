# AWS Usage Forecast - Number of Instance vCPUs Used

## Deprecated

This policy template is no longer being updated. The [AWS Usage Forecast - Instance Time Used](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/tree/master/operational/aws/total_instance_usage_forecast/) policy now includes this functionality and should be used instead.

## What It Does

This Policy leverages Flexera CCO APIs to determine a usage forecast for a view of AWS instance vCPUs used within the entire Organization. The policy uses the specified previous number of months, not including the current month to to determine a straight-line forecast using a linear regression model.

## How It Works

- This policy template uses the last month before current to guarantee full data.
- This policy supports filtering by a specific AWS region or the entire Organization.
- This policy produces a straight-line forecast by calculating a line of best fit (linear regression line) from the historical dataset and then extrapolating this to calculate forecasted costs.
- The forecast is displayed as a stacked-bar chart showing Total Instance vCPUs by Instance Family for the top 8 most used Instance Families. All other Instance Families will be aggregated and displayed as "Other". Values shown in the graph are for the past 12 months.

## Input Parameters

This policy template has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Region* - Name of the AWS Region to filter by. Example: 'US West (Oregon)'. Leave this blank for 'Organization' scope.
- *Lookback Months* - Number of months to lookback to generate forecast.
- *Months to forecast* - Number of months in the future to forecast.
- *Email addresses to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify.
