# AWS Instance Scheduled Events

## What it does

This policy checks for any scheduled event on EC2 instances that could cause operational issues, such as an instance reboot, stop, retirement, system reboot and system maintenance.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS EC2 API to discover any scheduled events on EC2 instances and provides the details in a report emailed to the specified users.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed Regions* - A list of allowed regions for an AWS account. Please enter the allowed regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Email addresses to notify* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created
- *Tags to ignore* - List of tags that will exclude resources from being evaluated by this policy. Multiple tags are evaluated as an 'OR' condition. Tag keys or key/value pairs can be listed. Example: 'test,env=dev'
