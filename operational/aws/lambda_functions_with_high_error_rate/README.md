# AWS Lambda Functions with high error rate

## What it does

Checks for lambda functions with errors, and lambda function over the `Error Rate Percentage` will be reported on.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the AWS ec2 API to examine vpc and flowlog details. When a vpc without flowlogs enabled is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed Regions* - A list of allowed regions for an AWS account. Please enter the allowed regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Error Rate Percentage* - Items above this percentage will be reported on. `Number Only!`
- *Ignore tags* - Lambda Functions with any of these tags will be ignored
