# AWS Lambda Functions With High Error Rate

## What It Does

This Policy Template gathers data for all AWS Lambda functions in the given account and reports any whose error rate exceeds a user-specified threshold. Optionally, an email is sent with this report.

## How It Works

- The AWS Lambda API is used to gather a list of Lambda functions.
- The AWS CloudWatch API is used to determine the number of times each function was invoked and the number of times each function produced an error over the user-specified number of hours.
- The error rate is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of errors by the number of invocations.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [More information is available in our documentation.](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)
- *Error Rate Percentage* - Percentage of requests that result in an error to include a Lambda function in the results.
- *Statistic Lookback Period (Hours)* - How many hours back to look at CloudWatch data for AWS Lambda. This value cannot be set higher than 2160 because AWS does not retain metrics for longer than 90 days.
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Regions List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Regions List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - A list of regions to allow or deny for an AWS account. Please enter the regions code if SCP is enabled. See [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Exclusion Tags* - The policy will filter resources containing the specified tags from the results. The following formats are supported:
  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.
  - `Key==Value` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key:value pair.
  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
- *Exclusion Tags: Any / All* - Whether to filter instances containing any of the specified tags or only those that contain all of them. Only applicable if more than one value is entered in the `Exclusion Tags` field.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `sts:GetCallerIdentity`
  - `ec2:DescribeRegions`
  - `lambda:ListFunctions`
  - `lambda:ListTags`
  - `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`
  - `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                  "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                  "lambda:ListFunctions",
                  "lambda:ListTags",
                  "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                  "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
