## Policy Template Synchronization Tool

### What it does

This Policy Template can be used to synchronize (upload, overwrite, or alert) RS built-in policy templates in your account. It uses a json file stored in the github directory to determine a set of RightScale's current policy templates and then compares them with your current account policies (using the version) to take appropriate action.

### Usage

- The Policy Template Synchronization Policy Template will need to be uploaded to your account and set active. 
- There are currently two actions: `Email` and `Email and Upload`. 
- When you choose `Email` you will get an alert on the the policy templates that can be updated, and no further action will be taken. 
- When you choose `Email and Upload`, you will get an alert on the policy templates that can be updated and we will upload those policies to your account.
