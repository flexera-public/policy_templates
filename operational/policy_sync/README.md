## Policy Template Synchronization Policy Template

### What it does

This Policy Template uses a json file stored in the github directory to determine a set of active policies, and versions. It then compares those
 policies with your current account policy versions, and alerts on difference. 

### Usage
The Policy Template Synchronization Policy Template will need to be uploaded to your account and set active. There are currently two escalation options: `Email`,
and `Email and Upload`. When you choose `Email` you will get an alert on the the policy templates that can be updated, and no further action will be taken. 
When you choose `Email and Upload`, you will get an alert on the policy templates that can be updated and we will upload those policies to your account.
