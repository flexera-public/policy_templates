# AWS Account Credentials

## What It Does

This policy template tests whether the selected Azure credential is able to successfully make a "Subscriptions - List" REST API request to Azure. If this request succeeds, an incident is raised reporting the success, and optionally, this incident can be emailed. If this request fails, the policy template will fail to complete and will show an error in Flexera One.

__NOTE: This policy template is intended to be used in conjunction with its associated meta parent policy template to provide a complete report of all AWS accounts and the status of their associated cross-account roles. Please see the [Meta README](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/tree/master/automation/azure/azure_credential/META_README.md) for more information.__

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Azure Resource Manager Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_109256743_1124668) (*provider=azure_rm*) which has the following permissions:
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/read`

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
