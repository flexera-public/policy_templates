# Azure Credential

## What It Does

This policy template tests whether the selected Azure credential is able to successfully make a "Subscriptions - List" REST API request to Azure. If this request succeeds, an incident is raised reporting the success, and optionally, this incident can be emailed. If this request fails, the policy template will fail to complete and will show an error in Flexera One.

__NOTE: This policy template is intended to be used in conjunction with its associated meta parent policy template. Please see the [Meta README](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/tree/master/automation/azure/azure_credential/META_README.md) for more information.__

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Incident Table Rows for Email Body (#)* - The number of results to include in the incident table in the incident email. Set to '0' to not show an incident table at all, and '100000' to include all results. Does not impact attached CSV files or the incident as presented in Flexera One.
- *Attach CSV To Incident Email* - Whether or not to attach the results as a CSV file to the incident email.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy template you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy template. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy template, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy template. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Azure Resource Manager Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/provider-specific-credentials#azure-resource-manager) (*provider=azure_rm*) which has the following permissions:
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/read`

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/provider-specific-credentials#flexera) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`
  - `policy_viewer`
  - `policy_manager`*

  \* Only required for meta-policy self-termination; not required if not using the meta parent of this policy template.

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/provider-specific-credentials) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
