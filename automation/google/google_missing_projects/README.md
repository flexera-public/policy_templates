# Google Missing Projects

## What It Does

This policy template checks the stored Flexera CCO billing data for Google from 3 days ago to obtain a list of Google Projects that we have billing data for and compares that to the list of Google Projects returned by the Google Cloud Resource Manager API. An incident is raised and email sent containing any projects present in Flexera CCO but not returned by the Google Cloud Resource Manager API, as well as projects returned by the Google Cloud Resource Manager API but not present in Flexera CCO. The user can select which of those two reports they'd like to produce.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Report Selection* - Whether to report Projects missing in the Google Cloud Resource Manager API but present in CCO data, the opposite, or both.
- *Projects Ignore List* - A list of Project IDs/names to never include in the results. Leave blank to not filter results.
