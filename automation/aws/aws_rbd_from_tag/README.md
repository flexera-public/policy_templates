# AWS Rule-Based Dimension From Account Tags

## What It Does

This policy template creates and updates custom Rule-Based Dimensions that surface the specified AWS Account tag keys in the Flexera One platform. This allows costs to be sliced by the values of the tag keys in question. Rules added to these rule-based dimensions manually, or by other policy templates, will not be deleted.

NOTE: It is not recommended that you apply this policy template multiple times for multiple AWS master payer accounts. Flexera's internal data is used to gather AWS account tags and should contain tag data for any AWS master payer accounts that you're ingesting billing data for.

NOTE: If updating from a version of this policy template prior to version 3.0, it is recommended that you delete any existing rule-based dimensions generated by this policy template before applying it again.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Effective Date* - The month and year in YYYY-MM format that you want the rules to apply. This should be left at its default value in most cases to ensure that the rules apply to all costs, including historical costs.
- *Tag Keys* - A list of AWS account tag keys to build Rule-Based Dimensions from. Multiple tags can be specified for a single dimension by placing a single entry with each tag key separated by a semicolon (;) character. For example, a value of `env;environment;environ` will create one Rule-Based Dimension that checks the keys "env", "environment", and "environ" for values.
- *Dimension Names* - A list of names to give the Rule-Based Dimensions in the Flexera platform. Enter names in the same order as the tag keys in the `Tag Keys` field. Dimension names will be derived from tag keys directly if this list is left empty.
- *Lowercase Values* - Whether or not to normalize all values by converting them to lowercase. Note that, if the same value appears multiple times with different casing, and this option is disabled, the rule-based dimension will be rejected and this policy template will fail.
