# MSP Report: AWS Account Credentials

## What It Does

This policy template gathers all of the "AWS Account Credentials" incident data from the various child organizations of an MSP organization and provides a consolidated report. This policy template assumes that all of the child organizations have the [Meta Parent: AWS Account Credentials](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/tree/master/automation/aws/aws_account_credentials/META_README.md) policy template running and working as intended.
