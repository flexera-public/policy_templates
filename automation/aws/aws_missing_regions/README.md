# AWS Missing Regions

## What It Does

This policy template checks the list of AWS regions returned by an AWS `DescribeRegions` API request and tests each region with an EC2 `DescribeInstances` request to see if the Flexera AWS credential can actually run API requests against that region. An incident is raised and email sent with any regions that are inaccessible.

__NOTE: Meta Parent policy will only work if both the parent and the child are uploaded to the Flexera org and the "Uploaded Template" option is selected for the `Child Policy Template Source` parameter. This is because the child policy is *not* published in the catalog.__

## Input Parameters

This policy template has the following input parameters:

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [More information is available in our documentation.](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/provider-specific-credentials#aws)
- *Region Ignore List* - A list of regions to never include in the results. Leave blank to not filter results
- *Incident Table Rows for Email Body* - The number of results to include in the incident table in the incident email. Set to '0' to not show an incident table at all, and '100000' to include all results. Does not impact attached CSV files or the incident as presented in Flexera One.
- *Attach CSV To Incident Email* - Whether or not to attach the results as a CSV file to the incident email.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy template you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy template. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy template, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy template. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/provider-specific-credentials#aws) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `ec2:DescribeRegions`
  - `ec2:DescribeInstances`
  - `sts:GetCallerIdentity`

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                  "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                  "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/provider-specific-credentials#flexera) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`
  - `policy_viewer`
  - `policy_manager`*

  \* Only required for meta-policy self-termination; not required if not using the meta parent of this policy template.

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera-one/automation/automation-administration/managing-credentials-for-policy-access-to-external-systems/provider-specific-credentials) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
