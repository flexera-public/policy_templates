# README Guideline

This document provides guidance on how to properly write a Policy Template README file.  The purpose of this file to help the policy template developer create a proper readme file, expedite the pull request review process, and have a consistent feel across all README files.

The README file is an important artifact of the policy template.  It is the customer facing documentation and should be written as such.  The README file should be free of typos, spelling errors, easy to read and correct grammar.  

## Readme File Sections

The readme file contains a number of sections which describes the policy template details.  All sections should start with the Header 2 markdown (2 #, ##) for the name it should contain header 1 markdown (1 #, #).

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

All sections are required as noted.  Optional sections include Installation, Cost or Other

### Name (REQUIRED)

The policy name is the readme file header.  It begins with the Header 2 markdown characters ##.  The name should match the value of the name field inside the policy template.  The name includes the cloud supported and what it checks.  If the policy is multi cloud then the cloud can be excluded and only write what it checks

Example with supported cloud:

```markdown

## AWS Idle Compute Instances

```  

Example: Multi Cloud.

```markdown

## Unapproved Instance Types

```

### What It Does (REQUIRED)

This section should be exactly written as the short_description of the policy template without the links to the readme or docs site.  It should be a non-technical description of what the policy checks as well as it's action.  

Example:
Checks for AWS idle instances using CPU and Memory metrics and terminates them after approval.  

### Functional Description (REQUIRED)

In this section you describe how the policy functions, not what it does.  It should include which clouds, APIs and how checks are made.  This would be a good place to write some technical details about API usage and  metrics used for gathering details etc.

### Input Parameters (REQUIRED)

Inputs parameters are the fields displayed when applying the policy template.  Each parameter listed in the policy template should be added to the readme.  Include extra details that may not fit into the parameter label or description fields of the parameter.  The field label should be bolded and the description and other details leave unbolded.

Example:

- *Email notify list* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify.  
- *Other parameter* - include detail and extra information here.

### Actions (REQUIRED)

Include all the actions available to the user.  All policies will have at least one action, the email notification.  There could be other actions such as terminating or resizing an instance.  Include a list of all possible actions.

Example:

- Sends an email notification
- Terminate all instances after approval

### Required Permissions (REQUIRED)

Write any CMP/Optima user roles the policy manager needs to run the policy.  Also include any cloud specific permissions needed. It is not necessary to include permissions needed to apply the policy or approve incidents.

Some good examples are written in following policy policy_templates:

- [https://github.com/flexera/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/aws/elb/clb_unused](https://github.com/flexera/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/aws/elb/clb_unused)
- [https://github.com/flexera/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/azure/object_storage_optimization](https://github.com/flexera/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/azure/object_storage_optimization)

### Installation (OPTIONAL)

In this section include additional configuration needed to run the policy.  Additional information may include setting up credentials in Cloud Management, configuring an external system etc.

### Supported Clouds (OPTIONAL)

Show a list of the supported clouds for the policy.

Example:

- AWS
- Google
- ...

### Other (OPTIONAL)

Write additional details the policy designer, policy manager or policy approver may need to know to use or change the policy.

## Input Parameters

- *Email notify list* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify.  
- *Other parameter* - include detail and extra information here.

## Actions (REQUIRED)

Policy actions may include automation to alert or remediate violations found in the Policy Incident. Actions that destroy or terminate a resource generally require approval from the Policy Approver. This policy includes the following actions.  

- Sends and email notification
- list additional actions if any.  

## Required Permissions

### Required CMP Roles

- Cloud Management: admin or credential_viewer

### AWS Required Permissions

This policy requires permissions to describe AWS LoadBalancers, InstanceHealth, tags and DeleteLoadBalancer.
The Cloud Management automatically creates two credentials when connecting AWS to Cloud Management; AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. If you did not connect your AWS account to CMP you will need to add the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AND AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY credentials manually. Read more about [adding Credentials](https://docs.rightscale.com/cm/dashboard/design/credentials/#overview)
The IAM user credentials contained in those credentials will require the following permissions:

`` ```javascript
{
    "Version": "2012-06-01",
    "Statement":[{
    "Effect":"Allow",
    "Action":[
      "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
      "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeInstanceHealth",
      "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTags",
      "elasticloadbalancing:DeleteLoadBalancer"
    ],
    "Resource":"*"
    }
  ]
}
``` ``
