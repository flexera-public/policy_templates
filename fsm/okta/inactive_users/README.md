## Inactive Users - Okta

**As a best practice, this policy should only be applied to the Master Account, and not to each individual RightScale Account.**

### What it does

This Policy Template leverages the [Okta Users API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#list-users) to identify users that have not logged in for an extended period of time, and optionally will deactivate those users upon approval.  

### Prerequesites

- This Policy Template requires an Okta API Token to authenticate with the Okta API.  [This tutorial](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/overview/) describes how to create a new Token.
- The Okta API Token must then be stored as a RightScale Credential in the account in which this policy will be applied. The credential must be named `OKTA_API_KEY`.

### Functional Details

- This policy will target a specific Okta organization

#### Input Parameters
