## AWS Instance CloudWatch Utilization Policy

### What it does

This Policy Template gathers AWS CloudWatch data for instances on 30 day intervals. This is meant to be run as a monthly policy. 

### Cloud Management Required Permissions/AWS Required Permissions
- Cloud Management - The `credential_viewer`,`observer` roles
- Cloud Management - The `policy_designer`, `policy_manager` & `policy_publisher` roles
- AWS - The `CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess` AWS IAM Policy

### Functional Details

- This policy identifies all instances reporting performance metrics to CloudWatch whose CPU or Memory utilization is below the thresholds set in the **Average used memory percentage** and **Average used CPU percentage** parameters.
- The **Exclusion Tag Key** parameter is a string value.  Supply the Tag Key only.  Tag Values are not analyzed and therefore are not need.  If the exclusion tag key is used on an Instance, that Instance is presumed to be exempt from this policy.
- This policy sets the tag defined in the **Action Tag Key:Value** parameter on the underutilized instances that were identified.
-  If you get an **N/A** in a field you will need to install the [CloudWatch Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html) on the instance to get those metrics.
