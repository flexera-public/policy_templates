# AWS RDS Instance License Information

## Deprecated

This policy is no longer being updated. The [AWS Rightsize RDS Instances](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/aws/rightsize_rds_instances/) policy can be used with the `Underutilized Instance CPU Threshold (%)` parameter set to `100` to retrieve the same information.

## What it does

This Policy Template gathers AWS RDS Instance data related to licensing.

## Functional Details

- This policy identifies all RDS instances and provides details on engine, version, license, and vCPU.

## Input Parameters

- *Allowed/Denied Regions* - Whether to treat regions parameter as allow or deny list.

If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
