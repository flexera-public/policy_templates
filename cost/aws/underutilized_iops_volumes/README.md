# AWS Underutilized Provisioned IOPS EBS Volumes

## What It Does

Checks inefficient EBS disk utilization using provided IOPS Throughput thresholds.

## How It Works

- Retrieves all EBS volumes with Provisioned IOPS Volume Type (`io1`, `io2`)
- Retrieves utilization metrics for each Provisioned IOPS volume from CloudWatch
- Identifies Provisioned IOPS volumes that are underutilized by comparing the resource utilization to the parameter threshold
