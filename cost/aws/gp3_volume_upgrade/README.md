# AWS GP3 Upgradeable Volumes

## What it does

This Policy finds GP2 or IO1 volumes in the given account and recommends them for upgrade to GP3. A Policy Incident will be created with all of volumes that fall into these criteria.

Optionally, the user can specify one or more tags that if found on a volume will exclude the volume from the list.

### Policy savings details

The policy includes the estimated savings. The estimated savings is recognized if the resource is Upgraded. Optima is used to receive the estimated savings which is the product of the most recent full dayâ€™s cost of the resource \* 30. The savings are displayed in the *Estimated Monthly Savings* column. If the resource can not be found in Optima the value is `N/A`. The incident detail message includes the sum of each resource *Estimated Monthly Savings* as *Total Estimated Monthly Savings*.

If the AWS bill for the AWS account is registered in Optima in a different Flexera One org than the project where the policy template is applied, the *Flexera One Org ID for Optima* parameter can be set to the org where the AWS account is registered in Optima. Leaving this parameter set to `current` will result in using the same org as the project where the policy template is applied querying for Optima cost data.

If the user does not have the minimum required role of `billing_center_viewer` or if there is not enough data received from Optima to calculate savings, an appropriate message is displayed in the incident detail message along with the estimated monthly savings column value as `N/A` in the incident table.
