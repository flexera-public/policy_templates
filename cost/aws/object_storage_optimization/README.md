The Cloud Management Platform automatically creates two Credentials when connecting AWS to Cloud Management; AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. The IAM user credentials contained in those credentials will require the following permissions:

```javascript
{
  "Version": "2006-03-01",
  "Statement":[{
                "Effect":"Allow",
                "Action":["s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                          "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                          "s3:ListBucket",
                          "s3:GetObject",
                          "s3:GetObjectTagging",
                          "s3:PutObject",
                          "s3:DeleteObject"
