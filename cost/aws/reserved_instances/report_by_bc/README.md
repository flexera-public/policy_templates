## Reserved Instances Report by Billing Center

### What it does

This Policy Template generates a custom Reserved Instances report.  The Policy will index all Reserved Instances and then report on only the Reserved Instances that exist within an AWS Account that has been allocated to a specific Billing Center. Currently, only top-level Billing Centers are supported.

**Note:** For the most reliable data, target Billing Centers that are configured with account-based Allocation Rules only.

### Supported Clouds

- AWS

### Cost

This Policy Template does not launch any instances, and so does not incur any cloud costs.
