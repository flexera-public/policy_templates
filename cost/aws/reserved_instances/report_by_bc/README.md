# Reserved Instances Report by Billing Center

**As a best practice, this policy should only be applied to the Master Account, and not to each individual RightScale Account.**

## What it does

This Policy Template generates a custom Reserved Instances report.  The Policy will index all Reserved Instances and then report on only the Reserved Instances that exist within an AWS Account that has been allocated to a specific Billing Center. Currently, only top-level Billing Centers are supported.

**Note:** For the most reliable data, target Billing Centers that are configured with account-based Allocation Rules only.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

  - `actor`
