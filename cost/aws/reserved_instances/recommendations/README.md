## AWS Reserved Instances Recommendation Policy Template

## NOTE: These RI Purchase Recommendations are generated by AWS. This policy is will raise incidents based on those recommendations.

**As a best practice, this policy should only be applied to the Master Account, and not to each individual RightScale Account.**

### What it does
This Policy Template leverages the [AWS Cost Explorer API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation.html). It will raise incidents if AWS has any RI Purchase Recommendations, whose net savings exceeds the *Net Savings Threshold* parameter in the Policy.

It will email the user specified in `Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify`
