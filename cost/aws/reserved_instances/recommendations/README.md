# AWS Reserved Instances Recommendation

## What it does

This Policy Template reports any Reserved Instance Purchase Recommendations generated by AWS. The user can adjust which recommendations are reported via policy parameters.

> *NOTE: This Policy Template must be applied to the **AWS Organization Master Payer** account.*

## Functional Details

Recommendations are obtained via requests to the [AWS Reservation Purchase Recommendation API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation.html).

### Policy Savings Details

The policy includes the estimated savings. The estimated savings is recognized if the recommended reserved instance is purchased. The savings values are provided directly by the [AWS Reservation Purchase Recommendation API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation.html).

If the Flexera organization is configured to use a currency other than USD, the savings values will be converted from USD using the exchange rate at the time that the policy executes.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential.
