# AWS Reserved Instances Recommendation

NOTE: These RI Purchase Recommendations are generated by AWS. This policy will raise incidents based on those recommendations.

## What it does

This Policy Template leverages the [AWS Cost Explorer API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation.html). It will raise incidents if AWS has any RI Purchase Recommendations, whose net savings exceeds the *Net Savings Threshold* parameter in the Policy.

It will email the user specified in `Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify`

## Input Parameters

- *Look Back Period* - Number of days of prior usage to analyze
