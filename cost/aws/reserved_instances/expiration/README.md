# AWS Expiring Reserved Instances

## What it does

This Policy Template leverages the Optima Bill Data for AWS Reserved Instances. It will notify only if expiration is within the timeframe specified in `Number of days to prior to expiration date to trigger incident` field. It will email the user specified in `Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify`.
