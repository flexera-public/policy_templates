# AWS Reserved Instances Coverage

## What It Does

This policy template uses the [AWS Billing and Cost Management API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetReservationCoverage.html) to retrieve AWS Reserved Instances coverage information and presents it in a simple, easy-to-read report. Optionally, this report is emailed.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [More information is available in our documentation.](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)
- *Look Back Period (Days)* - Number of days in the past to assess AWS Reserved Instances coverage. Coverage will be assessed from this point in time until today.

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
