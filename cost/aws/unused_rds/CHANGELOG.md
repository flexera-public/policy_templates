# Changelog

## v4.0

- Deprecated `auth_rs` authentication (type: `rightscale`) and replaced with `auth_flexera` (type: `oauth2`).  This is a breaking change which requires a Credential for `auth_flexera` [`provider=flexera`] before the policy can be applied.  Please see docs for setting up [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm)
- Modified `sys_log` definition to disable `rs_cm.audit_entry.create` outside Flexera NAM
- Replaced references `github.com/rightscale/policy_templates` and `github.com/flexera/policy_templates` with `github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates`
