# AWS Unused RDS Policy

## What it does

This policy template checks for Unused RDS instances by reviewing the DBconnections and terminates them after user approval.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `ec2:DescribeRegions`
  - `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics`
  - `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`
  - `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                  "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                  "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                  "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.

## Functional Details

- This policy gets a list of RDS instances and uses CloudWatch DBConnection metric to check for connections over a 30 days period.  If there are no DBConnections the policy will terminate the RDS instance after the user approval.

### Policy savings details

The policy includes the estimated savings. The estimated savings is recognized if the resource is terminated. Optima is used to receive the estimated savings which is the product of the most recent full day's cost of the resource * 30. The savings is displayed in the Estimated Monthly Savings column. If the resource cannot be found in Optima the value is 0.0. The incident message detail includes the sum of each resource Estimated Monthly Savings as Total Estimated Monthly Savings.
If the user is missing the minimum required role of `billing_center_viewer` or if there is no enough data received from Optima to calculate savings, appropriate message is displayed in the incident detail message along with the estimated monthly savings column value as 0.0 in the incident table.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Allowed Regions* - A list of allowed regions for an AWS account. Please enter the allowed regions code if SCP is enabled, see [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [more](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)
- *Email addresses to notify* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created
- *Exclusion Tag Key:Value* - AWS tag key to ignore instances. Format: Key:Value
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).
- *CloudWatch API Wait Time* - The amount of time in seconds to wait between requests to the CloudWatch API to avoid being throttled by AWS. Default is recommended.

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example, if a user selects the "Delete Instances" action while applying the policy, all the resources that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be deleted.
