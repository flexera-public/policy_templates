# AWS Savings Plan Recommendations

## What It Does

This policy template reports any Savings Plan Purchase Recommendations generated by AWS. The user can adjust which recommendations are reported via policy parameters.

> *NOTE: This Policy Template must be applied to the **AWS Organization Master Payer** account.*

## How It Works

Recommendations are obtained via requests to the [AWS Savings Plans Purchase Recommendation API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation.html).

### Policy Savings Details

The policy template includes the estimated savings. The estimated savings is recognized if the recommended savings plan is purchased. The savings values are provided directly by the [AWS Savings Plans Purchase Recommendation API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation.html).

If the Flexera organization is configured to use a currency other than the one the [AWS Savings Plans Purchase Recommendation API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation.html) returns, the savings values will be converted using the exchange rate at the time that the policy executes.

## Input Parameters
