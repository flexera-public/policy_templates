# AWS Savings Plan Recommendations Policy Template

## NOTE: These Savings Plan Purchase Recommendations are generated by AWS. This policy will raise incidents based on those recommendations

### What it does

This Policy Template leverages the [AWS Cost Explorer API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation.html).

It will email the user specified in `Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify`

### AWS Required Permissions

This policy requires permissions to describe AWS Cost Explorer.
The Cloud Management Platform automatically creates two Credentials when connecting AWS to Cloud Management; AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. The IAM user credentials contained in those credentials will require the following permissions:

```javascript
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ce:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
