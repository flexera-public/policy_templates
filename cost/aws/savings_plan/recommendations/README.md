# AWS Savings Plan Recommendations

## NOTE: These Savings Plan Purchase Recommendations are generated by AWS. This policy will raise incidents based on those recommendations

### What it does

This Policy Template leverages the [AWS Cost Explorer API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation.html). It will raise incidents if AWS has any Savings Plan Purchase Recommendations, whose monthly savings exceeds the *Monthly Savings Threshold* parameter in the Policy.

It will email the user specified in `Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify`
