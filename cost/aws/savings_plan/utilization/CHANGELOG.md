# Changelog

## v4.0.1

- Fixed issue with numeric currency values sometimes showing 'undefined' instead of currency separators

## v4.0.0

- Policy can now be run against an arbitrary number of days in the past
- Policy can now filter for several Savings Plans at once
- Improved incident output for better readability
- Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution

## v3.3

- Updated policy metadata to align policy to other `Savings Plans` policies.

## v3.2

## v3.1

- Parameter `Savings Plan ARN` is now optional.  If not provided, the policy will return utilization for all Savings Plans in the account.
- Default threshold changed from `70` to `100`.  This is intended to enable the policy to enable the user to easy report on Savings Plan Utilization for all Savings Plans in the account.
- Payer Account ID added to the Incident Summary.  This is helpful for users with multiple AWS Payer Accounts.

## v3.0

- Deprecated `auth_rs` authentication (type: `rightscale`) and replaced with `auth_flexera` (type: `oauth2`).  This is a breaking change which requires a Credential for `auth_flexera` [`provider=flexera`] before the policy can be applied.  Please see docs for setting up [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm)
