# AWS Savings Plan Utilization

## What It Does

This Policy Template leverages the [AWS Savings Plans Utilization API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetSavingsPlansUtilization.html) to determine if any Savings Plans have low utilization and present a report of any offending Savings Plans. Optionally, this report can be emailed.

> *NOTE: This Policy Template must be applied to the **AWS Organization Master Payer** account.*

## How It Works

- This policy template uses [AWS Savings Plans Utilization API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetSavingsPlansUtilization.html) to retrieve Savings Plan Utilization data.
- That data is used to produce a pie chart showing Used Commitment, Unused Commitment and Utilization for each Savings Plan.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Look Back Period (Days)* - Specify the number of days of past usage to analyze.
- *Utilization Threshold* - Specify the minimum Savings Plan Utilization threshold as a percentage that should result in an alert.
- *Savings Plan ARNs* - The unique Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for particular Savings Plans to report on. Leave blank to report on all Savings Plans.
