## What it does

This Policy Template leverages the [AWS Savings Plans Utilization API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetSavingsPlansUtilization.html). It will raise incidents if the Utilization of the Savings Plan (specified in the *Savings Plan ARN* parameter) is below the *Savings Plan Utilization Threshold* parameter in the policy. It will email the user specified in *Email addresses to notify*.

> *NOTE: This Policy Template must be appled to the **AWS Organization Master Payer** account.*
