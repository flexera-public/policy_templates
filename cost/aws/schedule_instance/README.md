# AWS Schedule Instance

## What it does

This Policy Template allows you to schedule start and stop times for your instance, along with the option to terminate instance, update and delete schedule.

## How to Use

This policy relies on a tag with format 'schedule' to stop and start instances based on a schedule. The tag value defines the schedule with a start hour, stop hour and days of the week. The start and stop hour are in 24 hour format, and the days of the week are two character abbreviation for example: MO, TU, WE. See full example below.. Use a Timezone TZ value to indicate a timezone to stop/start the instance(s)

## Schedule Tag Example

Start and Stop hours are 24 hour format: for example 8:15-17:30 is start at 8:15am, and stop at 5:30pm.

Days of the week: SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA

Timezone: Use the TZ database name from the timezone list. For example use America/New_York for Eastern time.

Example: schedule=8:15-17:30;MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;America/New_York. Starts instances at 8:15am, stops instance at 5:30pm, Monday - Friday, Eastern Time.

Instances are off during the weekend and start back up on Monday morning at 8:15am and are off at 5:30pm every weekday. Times are UTC unless the Timezone field is provided.
