# AWS S3 Incomplete Multi-Part Uploads

## What It Does

This policy template reports incomplete multi-part uploads in AWS S3 buckets. Optionally, these uploads can be aborted and the report can be emailed.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Account Number* - The Account number for use with the AWS STS Cross Account Role. Leave blank when using AWS IAM Access key and secret. It only needs to be passed when the desired AWS account is different than the one associated with the Flexera One credential. [More information is available in our documentation.](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1123608)
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Regions List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Regions List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - A list of regions to allow or deny for an AWS account. Please enter the regions code if SCP is enabled. See [Available Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions) in AWS; otherwise, the policy may fail on regions that are disabled via SCP. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Exclusion Tags* - The policy template will filter resources containing the specified tags from the results. The following formats are supported:
  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.
  - `Key==Value` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key:value pair.
  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
- *Exclusion Tags: Any / All* - Whether to filter instances containing any of the specified tags or only those that contain all of them. Only applicable if more than one value is entered in the `Exclusion Tags` field.
- *Minimum Size (Bytes)* - Minimum size, in bytes, of incomplete multi-part uploads to include in results. Uploads smaller than this size will not be reported.
- *Attach CSV To Incident Email* - Whether or not to attach the results as a CSV file to the incident email.
- *Incident Table Rows for Email Body (#)* - The number of results to include in the incident table in the incident email. Set to '0' to not show an incident table at all, and '100000' to include all results. Does not impact attached CSV files or the incident as presented in Flexera One.
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy template will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action. For example, if a user selects the "Abort Incomplete Multi-Part Uploads" action while applying the policy template, all reported incomplete multi-part uploads will be aborted.

## Policy Actions

- Send an email report
- Abort incomplete multi-part uploads after approval

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy template you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy template. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy template, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy template. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**AWS Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_1982464505_1121575) (*provider=aws*) which has the following permissions:
  - `sts:GetCallerIdentity`
  - `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
  - `s3:GetBucketLocation`
  - `s3:GetBucketTagging`
  - `s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads`
  - `s3:ListMultipartUploadParts`
  - `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`*

  \* Only required for taking action; the policy will still function in a read-only capacity without these permissions.

  Example IAM Permission Policy:

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
                  "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                  "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                  "s3:GetBucketTagging",
                  "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                  "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                  "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
