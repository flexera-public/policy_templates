# Superseded Instances Policy Template

## What it does

The Superseded Instances Policy Template is used to monitor an account a generate a list of superseded instances. This policy supports AWS, Azure, and AzureCSP. It also allows use of AMD, and Burstable types as replacement. There are fundamental differences between this and Optima Superseded Instances recommendations.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.

## Usage

This policy used Optima data to get a list of instances used in the month and their possible new types, as well it uses data in [Policies Data](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/tree/master/data) to determine if an instance type has been superseded.  It will then list all the instances that have been superseded and their types. The `Monthly Estimated Cost` is an estimated cost for the instances with the current configuration, you will save a portion of that by moving to the instance type, the new instance types should be more performant as well. If the **New Instance Type** value in the incident report is "Unavailable", the current instance type does not currently exist in our Instance Type mapping.  Please raise an issue for the mapping to be updated with the current instance type.
