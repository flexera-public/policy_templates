### Terminate Instances with End Date Policy

**What it does**

This Policy allows you to set a tag with a timestamp and terminate an instance at a specific time. It will not terminate locked instances. 

**How to Use**

This policy relies on a tag to terminate instances based on a schedule.  The tag value is in a timestamp notation.

You can use the following example when tagging your instances. If you tag in the cloud natively you can ignore `ec2`,`gce`,`azure`, Flexera CMP will automatically add that on discovery.

***Instance Terminate Tag Example***

***Rightscale***
  * `instance:terminate=2019-05-20T13:48:21Z`

***Tag to set in cloud provider***
  * `terminate=2019-05-20T13:48:21Z`

***Tag discovered by CMP***
  * `ec2:terminate=2019-05-20T13:48:21Z`
  * `gce:terminate=2019-05-20T13:48:21Z`
  * `azure:terminate=2019-05-20T13:48:21Z`
