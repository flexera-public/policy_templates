# New Usage

## What It Does

This policy compares billing data from 3 days ago to billing data from a user-specified number of days ago (10 by default) to see if any new usage types exist for the user-specified dimension. For example, if the user specifies the `Service` dimension, any new values for this dimension that did not exist previously will be reported. A list of the new usage types and their estimated monthly cost is raised as an incident and, optionally, emailed.

## How It Works

The policy includes the estimated monthly cost. Flexera's Cloud Cost Optimization (CCO) API is used to retrieve cloud costs for a full day (3 days ago). The daily cost of any new values for the user-specified dimension are then multiplied by 30.44 (the average number of days in a month). The cost is displayed in the Estimated Monthly Cost column. The incident message detail includes the sum of each product *Estimated Monthly Cost* as *Potential Monthly Cost*.
