# Vendor Spend Commitment Forecast

## What It Does

This policy template calculates the total projected spend for the user-specified cloud vendor (or all spend if no vendor is specified) for the specified time period and compares that projection to a user-specified commitment target. The results, along with a chart, are provided in a report. Optionally, this report can be emailed.

The purpose of this policy template is to assist in tracking and projecting total spend with a cloud vendor to ensure that any discounts due to spend commitments are not lost due to insufficient spend.

**NOTE: This policy template is for cloud vendor spend commitments, not Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, Committed Use Discounts, or similar rate reduction purchasing constructs.**

## Example Incident

## How It Works

Projected spend is extrapolated from the spend of whatever portion of the specified time period is in the past. Future spend is assumed to be straight-forwardly commensurate with past spend. For example, if the time period specified is for 1 year, and 1 month has passed, then the projected spend will be the spend for that month multiplied by 12.
