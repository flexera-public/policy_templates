# Low Service Usage Policy

## What it does

This Policy Template reports on services with low usage. Low usage of a specific service in a region by an account is often indicative of tests or experiments by users, which often are forgotten and left running. Investigate this usage to determine if it should be terminated or potentially consolidated into a larger account/region for ease of management.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
