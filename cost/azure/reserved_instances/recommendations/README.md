# Azure Reserved Instances Recommendations

## What It Does

This policy template reports any Reserved Instance Purchase Recommendations generated by Azure. The user can adjust which recommendations are reported via policy parameters.

## How It Works

Recommendations are obtained via requests to the [Azure Consumption API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/consumption/reservation-recommendations/list?view=rest-consumption-2024-08-01&tabs=HTTP).

### Policy Savings Details

The policy template includes the estimated savings. The estimated savings is recognized if the recommended reserved instance is purchased. The savings values are provided directly by the [Azure Consumption API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/consumption/reservation-recommendations/list?view=rest-consumption-2024-08-01&tabs=HTTP).

If the Flexera organization is configured to use a currency other than the one the [Azure Billing API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/billing/billing-accounts/list?view=rest-billing-2024-04-01&tabs=HTTP) returns, the savings values will be converted using the exchange rate at the time that the policy executes. If the policy is unable to obtain the currency code from the [Azure Billing API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/billing/billing-accounts/list?view=rest-billing-2024-04-01&tabs=HTTP) due to the Azure credential lacking the `Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/read` permission, values will not be converted and will be presumed to already be in the currency the Flexera organization is configured to use.

If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy template, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy template. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Azure Resource Manager Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_109256743_1124668) (*provider=azure_rm*) which has the following permissions:
