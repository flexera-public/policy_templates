# Azure China Common Bill Ingestion

## Deprecated

This policy template is no longer being updated. Flexera Cloud Cost Optimization now supports native ingestion of Azure China bills. Please see the [Azure China documentation](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Administration/BillConnectConfigsAzureChina.htm) for more information.

## What It Does

This Policy Template is used to automatically take billing data for Azure China and send the data to Flexera CBI so that Azure China costs are visible in Flexera One.

## How It Works

- The policy uses the Azure China Usage Report API to retrieve Azure China billing data for user-specified month for the provided Enrollment ID.
- The policy then sends this data, unmodified, into the Flexera Common Bill Ingestion endpoint so that the data can be ingested and then become visible on the Flexera One platform.

## Input Parameters

This policy template has the following input parameters:

- *Month To Ingest* - Whether to process bills for the current month, previous month, or a specific month.
- *Billing Period* - The year and month to process bills for in YYYY-MM format. Only relevant if Specific Month is selected for the Month To Ingest parameter. Example: 2022-09
- *Azure Enrollment ID* - Your Azure EA Enrollment ID from Azure China Billing Portal
- *Flexera CBI Endpoint* - Name of the Flexera CBI endpoint to use. Ex: cbi-oi-azure-china-myaccount
