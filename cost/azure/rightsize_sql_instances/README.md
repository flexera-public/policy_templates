# Azure Rightsize SQL Databases

## What it does

This policy will look at Utilization of Azure SQL databases and recommend up or down sizing after user approval.

## Functional Details

This policy checks all the Azure SQL databases for a Azure Subscription. It does a Average CPU usage over the last 30 days. It then checks if the Utilization is Lower than the Downsize Threshold or higher that Upsize Threshold. Finally it displays the found data, recommendations and provides option to Downsize or Upsize the SQL database after the user approval.

- This policy applies only for Upsize or Downsize of DTUs/vCores within tiers.
- This policy will not be applicable to resize between service tiers.
- If the SQL database can not downsize because it's already at it's min size or can not upsize because it's already at it's max. then in the 'Recommended Capacity' column shows as 'n/a' for resize within tiers.
