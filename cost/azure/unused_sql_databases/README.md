# Azure Unused SQL Databases

## What it does

This Policy template checks for Azure SQL Databases that are unused by reviewing the DB connections and delete them after user approval.

## Functional Details

This policy gets a list of Azure SQL Databases and uses the DB Connection metric to check for successful connections over a 30-day period. If there are no successful DB Connections the policy will terminate the SQL databases after the user approval.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email addresses to notify* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created
- *Exclusion Tag Key* - Azure-native SQL Database tag key to ignore databases. Only supply the tag key. The policy assumes that the tag value is irrelevant.
- *Azure Endpoint* - Azure Endpoint to access resources
- *Subscription Whitelist* - Whitelisted Subscriptions, if empty, all subscriptions will be checked
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Terminate Instances" action while applying the policy, all the instances that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be terminated.
