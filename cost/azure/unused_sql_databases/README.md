## Azure Unused SQL Databases
 
### What it does

This Policy template checks for Azure SQL Databases that are unused by reviewing the DB connections and delete them after user approval.

### Functional Details

This policy gets a list of Azure SQL Databases and uses the DB Connection metric to check for successful connections over a 30-day period. If there are no successful DB Connections the policy will terminate the SQL databases after the user approval.
