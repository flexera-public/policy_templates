# Azure Hybrid Use Benefit for Linux Server

## What it does

This Policy Template is used to automatically apply the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit (AHUB) to all eligible Linux VMs in an Azure Subscription.

## Functional Details

- The policy identifies all Linux server instances that could utilize [Azure Hybrid Use Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/) but are not currently using it. It raises an incident for all applicable VMs not currently using AHUB with the option to automatically enable AHUB on all identified instances.
- Before enabling AHUB for RHEL, you must enable your [Red Hat products for Cloud Access](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access) on Azure through Red Hat Subscription Management.
- This policy does not track licenses or availability. It is your responsibility to ensure you are not under licensed.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email Addresses* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Azure Endpoint* - Azure Endpoint to access resources
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Allow or Deny entered Subscriptions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Allow or Deny entered regions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - A list of allowed or denied regions. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
- *Exclusion Tags* - The policy will filter resources containing the specified tags from the results. The following formats are supported:
  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.
  - `Key==Value` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key:value pair.
  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
- *Exclusion Tags: Any / All* - Whether to filter instances containing any of the specified tags or only those that contain all of them. Only applicable if more than one value is entered in the `Exclusion Tags` field.
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Apply Hybrid Use Benefit" action while applying the policy, all of the Linux VMs without AHUB that qualify will have AHUB enabled.

## Prerequisites

This policy uses [credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for connecting to the cloud -- in order to apply this policy, you must have a credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your cloud admin and ask them to register a credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential.

### Credential configuration

For administrators [creating and managing credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) to use with this policy, the following information is needed:

- [**Azure Resource Manager Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_109256743_1124668) (*provider=azure_rm*) which has the following permissions:
  - `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read`
  - `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`*

\* Only required for taking action (applying AHUB to VMs); the policy will still function in a read-only capacity without these permissions.

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`
