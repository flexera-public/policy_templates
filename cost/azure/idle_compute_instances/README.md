# Azure Idle Compute Instances

## What it does

This policy checks all the instances in the Azure Subscription for the average CPU usage over the last 30 days.  If the usage is less than the user provided CPU percentage threshold then the virtual machines are recommended for deletion, and the user is emailed.

## Functional Details

The policy leverages the Azure API to check all instances and then checks the instance average CPU utilization over the past 30 days, finally recommending the low ones for deletion after approval.

## Input Parameters

- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *CPU Threshold* - Percentage of CPU utilization
- *Exclusion Tag Key* - An Azure-native instance tag to ignore instances that you don't want to consider for downsizing. Only supply the tag key
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Terminate Instances" action while applying the policy, all the resources that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be terminated.
