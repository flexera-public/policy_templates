# Azure Unused IP Addresses

## What it does

This Policy Template scans all IP addresses in the given account and identifies any unused IP addresses. If any are found, an incident report will show the IP addresses, and related information, and an email will be sent to the user-specified email address. If the user approves that the IP addresses should be deleted, the policy will delete the IP addresses. Optionally, the user can specify one or more tags that if found on an IP address will exclude the IP address from the list.

### Policy savings details

The policy includes the estimated savings. The estimated savings is recognized if the resource is terminated. Optima is used to receive the estimated savings which is the product of the most recent full day's cost of the resource * 30. The savings is displayed in the Estimated Monthly Savings column. If the resource can not be found in Optima the value is 0.0. The incident message detail includes the sum of each resource Estimated Monthly Savings as Total Estimated Monthly Savings.
If the user is missing the minimum required role of `billing_center_viewer` or if there is no enough data received from Optima to calculate savings, appropriate message is displayed in the incident detail message along with the estimated monthly savings column value as 0.0 in the incident table.
