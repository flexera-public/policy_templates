# Azure Unused IP Addresses

## What it does  

This Policy Template scans all IP addresses in the given account and identifies any unused IP addresses. If any are found, an incident report will show the IP addresses, and related information, and an email will be sent to the user-specified email address. If the user approves that the IP addresses should be deleted, the policy will delete the IP addresses. Optionally, the user can specify one or more tags that if found on an IP address will exclude the IP address from the list.

## Input Parameters  

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email Addresses* - A list of email addresses to notify 
- *Exclude Tags* - A list of tags used to excluded IP addresses from the incident.
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Delete Unused IP Addresses" action while applying the policy, all the unused IP addresses will be deleted.

## Policy Actions

- Send an email report
