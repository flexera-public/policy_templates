# Azure Hybrid Use Benefit Policy for SQL

## What It Does

This Policy Template is used to automatically apply the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit (AHUB) to all eligible SQL instances in an Azure Subscription.

## How It Works

- The policy identifies all SQL databases in Azure that are not currently using [Azure Hybrid Use Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/). These can be SQL Virtual Machines, SQL Elastic Pools, SQL Databases or SQL Managed Instances. It raises an incident for all applicable instances not currently using AHUB, which once approved, will enable AHUB on all identified instances.
- This policy does not track licenses or availability. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have valid licenses for all resources that AHUB is enabled for.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email Addresses* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Azure Endpoint* - Azure Endpoint to access resources
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Allow or Deny entered Subscriptions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Allow or Deny entered regions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - A list of allowed or denied regions. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
- *Exclusion Tags* - The policy will filter resources containing the specified tags from the results. The following formats are supported:
  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.
  - `Key==Value` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key:value pair.
  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
- *Exclusion Tags: Any / All* - Whether to filter instances containing any of the specified tags or only those that contain all of them. Only applicable if more than one value is entered in the `Exclusion Tags` field.
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Apply Hybrid Use Benefit" action while applying the policy, all of the resources without AHUB that qualify will have AHUB enabled.
