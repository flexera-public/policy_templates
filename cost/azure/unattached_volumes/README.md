# Azure Unused Volumes

## What it does

This Policy Template scans all volumes in the given account and identifies any volume that has been unused for at least the number of days specified by user. Using activity logs, we will determine the number of days the volume has been unused. If any are found, an incident report will show the volumes and related information. An email will be sent to the user-specified email address.

If the user approves that the volumes should be deleted, the policy will delete the volumes.
If the volume is not getting deleted, say, because it is locked, then the volume will be tagged to indicate the error that was received.

If the issue causing delete failure is removed, the next run of the policy will delete the volume.
Note: Unused volumes report will reflect the updated set of unused volumes on the subsequent run.

Optionally, the user can specify one or more tags that if found on a volume will exclude the volume from the list.

### Policy savings details

The policy includes the estimated savings.  The estimated savings is recognized if the resource is terminated.   Optima is used to receive the estimated savings which is the product of the most recent full day’s cost of the resource * 30.  The savings is displayed in the Estimated Monthly Savings column.  If the resource can not be found in Optima the value is n/a.  The incident detail message includes the sum of each resource Estimated Monthly Savings as Total Estimated Monthly Savings.
If the user is not having the minimum required role of `billing_center_viewer` or if there is no enough data received from Optima to calculate savings, appropriate message is displayed in the incident detail message along with the estimated monthly savings column value as N/A in the incident table.
