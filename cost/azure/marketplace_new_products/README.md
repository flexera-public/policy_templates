# Azure New Marketplace Products

## What it does

This policy compares Azure billing data from 3 days ago to billing data from a user-specified number of days ago (10 by default) to see if any new Marketplace products have been purchased since then. A list of the new products and their estimated monthly cost is raised as an incident and, optionally, emailed.

## Functional Details

- The policy leverages the Flexera Optima API to retrieve aggregated amortized costs from each Azure bill source.
- Costs are filtered accordingly based on the kind of Azure bill source. Old bill sources pull the `usage_type` dimension and filter by the `Microsoft.Marketplace` service, while newer bill sources pull the `resource_type` dimension and filter by `manufacturer_name` not containing the substring "Microsoft".
- The list of products from 3 days ago is compared to the older list to find any new items and their cost.

### Policy Cost Reporting Details

The policy includes the estimated monthly cost. Optima is used to retrieve the cost of the Marketplace product for a full day (3 days ago) which is then multiplied by 30.44 (the average number of days in a month). The cost is displayed in the Estimated Monthly Cost column. The incident message detail includes the sum of each resource *Estimated Monthly Cost* as *Potential Monthly Cost*.

## Input Parameters

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Look Back Period (Days)* - How far back, in days, to look at Marketplace product purchases to see if new items have been added.
- *Minimum Cost Threshold* - Minimum monthly cost to report on new Marketplace products.
