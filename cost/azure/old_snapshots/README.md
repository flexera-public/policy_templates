# Azure Old Snapshots

## What It Does

This Policy finds Azure snapshots older than the specified number of days and raises an incident with a list of said snapshots. Optionally, it will delete them.

## How It Works

The policy makes use of the Azure Resource Manager API to obtain a list of snapshots and their ages in order to produce a list of recommendations.

### Policy Savings Details

The policy includes the estimated monthly savings. The estimated monthly savings is recognized if the resource is terminated.

- The `Estimated Monthly Savings` is calculated by multiplying the amortized cost of the resource for 1 day, as found within Flexera CCO, by 30.44, which is the average number of days in a month.
- Since the costs of individual resources are obtained from Flexera CCO, they will take into account any Flexera adjustment rules or cloud provider discounts present in the Flexera platform.
- If the resource cannot be found in Flexera CCO, the `Estimated Monthly Savings` is 0.
- The incident message detail includes the sum of each resource `Estimated Monthly Savings` as `Potential Monthly Savings`.
- Both `Estimated Monthly Savings` and `Potential Monthly Savings` will be reported in the currency of the Flexera organization the policy is applied in.

## Input Parameters

This policy template has the following input parameters:

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created.
- *Azure Endpoint* - The endpoint to send Azure API requests to. Recommended to leave this at default unless using this policy with Azure China.
- *Snapshot Age Threshold* - The number of days since the snapshot was created to consider a snapshot old.
- *Minimum Savings Threshold* - Minimum potential savings required to generate a recommendation.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions* - Allow or Deny entered Subscriptions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Subscriptions List* - A list of allowed or denied Subscription IDs/names. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Allow or Deny entered regions to filter results.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - A list of allowed or denied regions. Leave blank to check all Subscriptions.
- *Exclusion Tags* - The policy will filter resources containing the specified tags from the results. The following formats are supported:
  - `Key` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key.
  - `Key==Value` - Filter all resources with the specified tag key:value pair.
  - `Key!=Value` - Filter all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
  - `Key=~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
  - `Key!~/Regex/` - Filter all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string. This will also filter all resources missing the specified tag key.
- *Exclusion Tags: Any / All* - Whether to filter instances containing any of the specified tags or only those that contain all of them. Only applicable if more than one value is entered in the `Exclusion Tags` field.
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example if a user selects the "Delete Snapshots" action while applying the policy, all the snapshots that didn't satisfy the policy condition will be deleted.

## Policy Actions

The following policy actions are taken on any resources found to be out of compliance.

- Send an email report
- Delete old snapshots after an approval

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy template you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy template. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy template, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy template. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Azure Resource Manager Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_109256743_1124668) (*provider=azure_rm*) which has the following permissions:
  - `Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/read`
  - `Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/delete`*

  \* Only required for taking action; the policy will still function in a read-only capacity without these permissions.

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.
