## How It Works

- This policy currently supports only a view of savings realized from Azure Reserved Instances.
- This policy supports a view of savings realized for a list of specific billing centers or for the entire Organization.
- This policy template uses the on-demand rate and the reserved instance rate by instance type and region to derive a savings rate. The policy then uses usage amount to calculate total savings realized.
- This policy produces a bar chart showing savings realized vs. total actual spend for the period of historical months specified.
