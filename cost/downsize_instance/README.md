## Downsize Instances Policy Template

### What it does

This Policy Template uses user defined to determine if you can decrease the size of your running instance.  

### Usage

The Downsize Instances Policy Template is used to actually downsize instances user defined tags on the instances.  The policy will use the *Tags to find instances* list to find the instances with provided tags and downsize them.  The tags must be inform of a [RightScale Tag](https://docs.rightscale.com/cm/ref/list_of_rightscale_tags.html#overview)
To downsize the instance it must be **stopped**.  If you don't want to stop and resize the instance you can add an additional tag and include that tag in the *Tags to ignore instances* input.
If a server is marked `N/A`, no action will be taken and only the resize tag will be removed. You will need to manually move that instance to another family type.
When an instance is downsized a new tag *rs_downsize:cooldown* is added which value is the date and time of the number of days from the Downsize to the Cooldown Days parameter.  This tag is then deleted after the Cooldown Days has exceeded
