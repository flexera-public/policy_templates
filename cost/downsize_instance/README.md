## Downsize Instances Policy Template

### What it does

This Policy Template uses data from the monitoring api to determine is you can decrease the size of your running instance.

### Usage

There are two policy templates required to support this policy, `Downsize Instances Policy Template` and `Downsize Instances Add Tags Policy Template`.
The Downsize Instances Policy Template is used to actually downsize instances. If you chose `Email` from the `Escalation Options`, it will only email you which instances can be downsized.
If you chose `Downsize And Email` from the `Escalation Options`, it will email you a list of servers that were downsized and the size to which were changed. This policy will also resize the instance. This required the instance to be **stopped**.
If a server is marked `N/A`, no action will be taken and only the resize tag will be removed. You will need to manually move that instance to another family type. 
**_This policy requires [RightLink 10](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl10/getting_started.html) and monitoring to be enabled_**, see [Installation](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl10/about.html)
