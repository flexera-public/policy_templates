# Kubecost Request Rightsizing Recommendations Policy Template

## What it does

Kubecost request sizing recommendations policy provides Kubecost recommendations for container resource requests along with estimated savings.

## Functional Details

- The policy requests recommendations for request right-sizing based on parameters provided.
- The [container request right sizing recommendation API](https://docs.kubecost.com/apis/apis-overview/api-request-right-sizing-v2) provides recommendations for container resource requests based on configurable parameters and estimates the savings from implementing those recommendations on a per-container, per-controller level. Of course, if the cluster-level resources stay static then you will likely not enjoy real savings from applying these recommendations until you reduce your cluster resources. Instead, your idle allocation will increase.
