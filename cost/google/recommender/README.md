# Google Recommender Policy

## What It Does

This policy reports on any existing recommendations generated by the Google Recommender service. Optionally, the user can filter results by recommendation type, project ID/name, or region.

### How It Works

This policy gathers cloud native Google recommendations using the Google Recommender API. More information is available in Google's documentation:

- [Google Cloud Recommenders](https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/recommenders)

## Input Parameters

- *Recommenders* - Google Recommenders to report on. Only selected options will be reported on.
- *Minimum Savings Threshold* - Minimum potential savings required to generate a recommendation.
- *Allow/Deny Projects* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Projects List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Projects List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Projects List* - Filter results by project ID/name, either only allowing this list or denying it depending on how the above parameter is set. Leave blank to consider all projects

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Google Cloud Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_4083446696_1121577) (*provider=gce*) which has the following:
  - `resourcemanager.projects.get`
  - `recommender.computeAddressIdleResourceRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.computeDiskIdleResourceRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.computeImageIdleResourceRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.computeInstanceIdleResourceRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.computeInstanceMachineTypeRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.cloudsqlInstanceOutOfDiskRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.usageCommitmentRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.computeInstanceGroupManagerMachineTypeRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.loggingProductSuggestionContainerRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.monitoringProductSuggestionComputeRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.resourcemanagerProjectUtilizationRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.cloudSecurityGeneralRecommendations.list`*
  - `recommender.runServiceSecurityRecommendations.list`*

  \* Only required if the specific recommendation is desired.

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.

Additionally, this Policy Template requires that several APIs be enabled in your Google Cloud environment:

- [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)
- [Recommender API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=recommender.googleapis.com)

## Supported Clouds

- Google

## Cost

This Policy Template does not incur any cloud costs.

## API Quotas

Google sets quotas on the Recommender API; this will cause a `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` response when the quota is exceeded. See [Quotas & Limits](https://cloud.google.com/recommender/quotas) for more information.
