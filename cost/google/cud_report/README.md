## Google Committed Use Discount (CUD) Report
 
####  As a best practice, this policy should only be applied to the Master Account, and not to each individual RightScale Account.
 
### What it does
This policy identifies all CUDs that exist in a given GCP project and provides a report listing them all. It can optionally report on all CUDs or only those that are active or expired.
 
### Functional Details
 
- Uses the GCP API to get a list of all CUDs and report on them.
- Create a service account (if not exists) with owner role under Google-cloud platform (IAM & admin -> service accounts). Generate key, a JSON file will get downloaded in which you can find 'client email' and 'private key' which has to be added as credentials in RightScale cloud management Design -> Credentials with name 'GC_SA_CLIENT_EMAIL' and 'GC_SA_PRIVATE_KEY' respectively.  
 
#### Input Parameters
 
- *Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify* - A list of email addresses to notify
- *Google Cloud Project* - Google cloud project Id where CUD's exist.
- *CUD Status* - Allow the user to choose from "All", "Active" or "Expired"
