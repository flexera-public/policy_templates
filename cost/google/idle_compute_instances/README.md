# Google Idle Compute Instances

## What it does

This Policy Template checks for idle instance in Google Compute Engine and then terminates them upon approval.

## Functional Details

- This policy identifies all instances reporting performance metrics to Google StackDriver and delivers a report, for instances whose CPU or Memory utilization is below the thresholds set in the **Average used memory percentage** and **Average used CPU percentage** parameters. These thresholds are what you would consider to be and idle instance.
- This policy can terminate instances after approval for instances that match the criteria.
- If you get an **N/A** in a field you will need to install the [StackDriver Agent](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/install-agent) on the instance to get those metrics.
- This policy only pulls running instances, as it is unable to get correct monitoring metrics from instances in other states
