# Google Rightsize CloudSQL Instances

## What it does

This Policy Template checks Google Cloud SQL instances based on provided CPU threshold over a 30 day average and resizes them after approval.

## Functional Details

- This policy identifies all Google CloudSQL instances reporting performance metrics to stackdriver whose CPU utilization is below the thresholds set in the **Average used CPU % - Downsize Threshold** and **Average used CPU % - Upsize Threshold** parameters.
- The **Exclusion Tag Key:Value** parameter is a string value.  Supply the Tag Key & Value.  If the exclusion tag is used on an CloudSQL Instance, that Instance is presumed to be exempt from this policy.
- The rightsizing escalation can be automated, executed after approval, or skipped.
