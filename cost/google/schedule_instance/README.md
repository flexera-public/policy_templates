# Google Schedule Instance

## What it does

This Policy Template allows you to schedule start and stop times for your Google instance, along with the option to terminate instance, update and delete schedule.

## How to Use

This policy relies on a label with format 'schedule' to stop and start instances based on a schedule. The label value defines the schedule with a start time(start hour and start minute), stop time(stop hour and stop minute), days of the week and timezone. The start and stop time are in 24 hour format, and the days of the week are two character abbreviation for example: mo, tu, we. See full example below.. Use a Timezone TZ value to indicate a timezone to stop/start the instance(s)

## schedule Label Example

Since google label supports only `-`, `_`, lowercase characters, numbers and International characters, The special characters in timezone should be replaced like `/` with `-`, `+` with `p` and `-`(minus) with `m` and all characters should be lowercase.
For example, the timezone `Etc/Gmt+10` should be used as `etc-gmtp10`, `Etc/GMT-4` as `etc-gmtm4`, `America/North_Dakota/New_Salem` as `america-north_dakota-new_salem`, `America/Port-au-Prince` as `america-port-au-prince` etc.

Start and Stop time are 24 hour format: for example 0830-1715 is start at 8:30am, and stop at 5:15pm.

Days of the week: su-mo-tu-we-th-fr-sa

Timezone: Use the TZ database name from the [timezone list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) in the above mentioned format.

Example: schedule=0830-1715_mo-tu-we-th-fr_america-new_york. Stops instances at 5:15pm, starts instance at 8:30am, Monday - Friday, Eastern Time(America/New_York).
Please note that `_` is being used for separating the start-stop time, days of the week and the timezone.

Instances are off during the weekend and start back up on Monday morning at 8:30am and are off at 5:15pm every weekday. Times are UTC unless the Timezone field is provided.

Note: Please note that for this policy to work, the time should be in 24 hour format and both hours and minutes must have 2 digits: `0800`for `8am` or `2130` for `9:30pm`.
Please refer the [formatted timezones list](https://github.com/flexera/policy_templates/blob/master/data/tz_database/timezones_list.json) having timezone in the above mentioned format as key and corresponding TZ database timezone as value.
