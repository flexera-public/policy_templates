# Google Inefficient Instance Utilization using StackDriver

## What it does

This Policy Template gathers Google StackDriver utilization for instances on 30 day intervals and resizes them after user approval.

## Functional Details

- This policy uses the Google API to get a list of instances and Google StackDriver for metrics for instance performance and delivers a report. If you get an **N/A** in a field you will need to install the [StackDriver Agent](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/install-agent) on the instance to get those metrics.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email addresses to notify* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify when new incidents are created
- *Google Cloud Project* - a Google Cloud Project ID
- *Average used memory percentage* - Utilization below this percentage will raise an incident to tag the instance.
- *Average used CPU percentage* - Utilization below this percentage will raise an incident to tag the instance.
- *Exclusion Tag Key* - An google-native instance tag to ignore instances that you don't want to consider for downsizing. Only supply the tag key
