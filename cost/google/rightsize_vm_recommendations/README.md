## Prerequisites

This policy uses [credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for connecting to the cloud -- in order to apply this policy you must have a credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your cloud admin and ask them to register a credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential.

The recommender API also needs to be [enabled.](https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/enabling#gcloud).

Here you can also check what are the permissions required depending on the recommender: [https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/recommenders](https://cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/recommenders)
