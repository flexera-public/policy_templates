# Google Idle Persistent Disk Recommender

## What It Does

This policy reports on any existing delete recommendations for persistent disks generated by the Google Recommender service. The user can then choose to delete the persistent disk if desired. Optionally, the user can filter results by label, project ID/name, or region.

### How It Works

This policy uses the following Google recommenders:

- `google.compute.disk.IdleResourceRecommender`: Checks if a persistent disk is idle and recommends deleting the idle disk.

More information is available in Google's documentation:

- [Viewing and applying idle resources recommendations](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/viewing-and-applying-idle-resources-recommendations)

### Policy Savings Details

The policy includes the estimated monthly savings. The estimated monthly savings is recognized if the resource is deleted.

- The `Estimated Monthly Savings` is obtained directly from the Google Recommender service.
- Since the savings estimates are obtained directly from Google, they will take into account any cloud provider discounts but *not* any Flexera adjustment rules or other cost manipulations specific to the Flexera platform.
- The incident message detail includes the sum of each resource `Estimated Monthly Savings` as `Potential Monthly Savings`.
- If the Flexera organization is configured to use a currency other than the one Google Recommender is reporting the savings estimates in, the savings values will be converted using the exchange rate at the time that the policy executes.

## Prerequisites

This Policy Template requires that several APIs be enabled in your Google Cloud environment:

- [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)
- [Compute Engine API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=compute.googleapis.com)
- [Recommender API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=recommender.googleapis.com)

This Policy Template uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Google Cloud Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm#automationadmin_4083446696_1121577) (*provider=gce*) which has the following:
  - Roles
    - `Monitoring Viewer`
    - `Compute Recommender Viewer`
    - `Compute Recommender Admin`*

  - Permissions
    - `recommender.computeDiskIdleResourceRecommendations.list`
    - `resourcemanager.projects.get`
    - `compute.disks.list`
    - `compute.snapshots.create`*
    - `compute.disks.createSnapshot`*
    - `compute.disks.delete`*
    - `compute.globalOperations.get`*
    - `compute.zoneOperations.get`*

\* Only required for taking action; the policy will still function in a read-only capacity without these permissions.

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `billing_center_viewer`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.

## Input Parameters

This policy has the following input parameters required when launching the policy.

- *Email Addresses* - Email addresses of the recipients you wish to notify.
- *Minimum Savings Threshold* - Minimum potential savings required to generate a recommendation.
- *Allow/Deny Projects* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Projects List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Projects List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Projects List* - Filter results by project ID/name, either only allowing this list or denying it depending on how the above parameter is set. Leave blank to consider all projects
- *Allow/Deny Regions* - Whether to treat Allow/Deny Regions List parameter as allow or deny list. Has no effect if Allow/Deny Regions List is left empty.
- *Allow/Deny Regions List* - Filter results by region, either only allowing this list or denying it depending on how the above parameter is set. Leave blank to consider all the regions.
- *Exclusion Labels (Key:Value)* - Google labels to ignore resources that you don't want to produce recommendations for. Use Key:Value format for specific label key/value pairs, and Key:\* format to match any resource with a particular key, regardless of value. Examples: env:production, DO_NOT_DELETE:\*
- *Create Final Snapshot* - Whether or not to take a final snapshot before deleting a disk.
- *Automatic Actions* - When this value is set, this policy will automatically take the selected action(s).

Please note that the "Automatic Actions" parameter contains a list of action(s) that can be performed on the resources. When it is selected, the policy will automatically execute the corresponding action on the data that failed the checks, post incident generation. Please leave it blank for *manual* action.
For example, if a user selects the "Delete Disks" action while applying the policy, all idle persistent disks will be deleted.

## Policy Actions

The following policy actions are taken on any resources found to be out of compliance.

- Send an email report
- Delete idle persistent disks after approval

## Supported Clouds

- Google

## Cost

This Policy Template does not launch any instances, and so does not incur any cloud costs.

## API Quotas

Google sets quotas on the Recommender API; this will cause a `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` response when the quota is exceeded. See [Quotas & Limits](https://cloud.google.com/recommender/quotas) for more information.
