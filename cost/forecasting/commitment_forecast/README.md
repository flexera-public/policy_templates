# Vendor Commitment Forecasting Policy

## What it does

This Policy uses Optima to determine a forecast against the commitment amount agreed with your Cloud Service Provider/s. This policy allows the user to specify a Commitment target value, and track the current commitment spend to date, as well as projected commitment spend for a given period. The commitment amount can be measured against a specific Cloud Provider spend or for the entire Organization spend.

The policy uses the specified previous number of months, not including the current month to determine a straight-line forecast.

## Functional Details

- This policy supports a commitment target amount for a single Cloud Service Provider (e.g., AWS) or the entire Organization.
- This policy produces a view of forecasted spend to the specified end date, based on previous spend to date from the specified start date.

### Input Parameters
