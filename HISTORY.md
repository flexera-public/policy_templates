## History
### PR [#1972](): POL-1186 Change History Generation
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This adds a new Github Action to generate two files every time a pull request is merged:
> 
> - `data/change_history/change_history.json`: A JSON file containing a full merge history for this repository, with the newest merges listed first.
> - `HISTORY.md`: A human readable version of the same data for more general, non-programmatic use.
> 
> This is to make it easier for both internal and external stakeholders to see what changes have been made, and to make it easier to provide meaningful regular updates about new policies, features, etc.

### PR [#1971](): POL-1185 Dangerfile Outdated Terminology Update
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Updates Outdated Terminology test for Dangerfile to look only for instances of "rightscale" and "optima" surrounded by whitespace so that false positives are not raised for built-in policy constructs like `rs_optima_host` or for API endpoints that are still in active use.
> 
> Also updates test to ignore contents of data/ and tools/ since these are autogenerated assets. Issues should be corrected in the actual source files, not in generated assets and tools.

### PR [#1966](): POL-1181 Dangerfile Test: Outdated Terminology
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> New Dangerfile test: Raises warnings if references to RightScale or Optima are present in a file and recommends alternative terminology. This is a warning, not an error, due to edge cases where it might make sense to reference these technologies directly in a historical context.

### PR [#1956](): POL-1173 Update AWS Instance Types JSON to include Memory
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> <!-- Describe what this change achieves below -->
> Adds Instance Memory field to the existing instance_types.json for AWS. Memory Unit is in Gigabytes (GiB or 1024^3 bytes)
> 
> Some Instance Types don't have a Memory field in the updated instance_types.json file, however they did not have a vCPU field previously either. Those Instance Types are as follows:
> 
> - 'cc1.4xlarge'
> - 'cg1.4xlarge'
> - 'g4.large'
> - 'g4.2xlarge'
> - 'g4.4xlarge'
> - 'g4.8xlarge'
> - 'g4.16xlarge'
> - 'hi1.4xlarge'
> - 'm6g.24xlarge'
> - 'm6gd.24xlarge'
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> <!-- List any existing issues this PR resolves below -->
> We have customers asking to produce a report of amount of Instance Memory used, similar to the existing Instance vCPUs used policy. To achieve this it will require adding memory to the Instance Types JSON file.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy

### PR [#1955](): POL-1172 Update AWS CloudFormation Template for Policies
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is an update to the AWS CloudFormation Template for Policies. The following changes were made:
> - Updated permissions across the board to match our current documentation.
> - Removed: Idle Compute policy since this policy is deprecated. 
> - Removed: Unused RDS policy since this policy is deprecated. 
> - Added: Rightsize RDS Instances
> - Added: Rightsize EBS Volumes
> - Added: Superseded Instances
> - Added: Unused Classic Load Balancers (CLBs)
> 
> During review for this, a typo was discovered in the permissions for the AWS Tag Cardinality Report README. This has been fixed, as well as all other linting errors for this file.
> 
> ### Example
> 
> This is the result of running this CFT, selecting for actions when possible, in our sales-sandbox account:
> 
> https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/roles/details/TestRole908734205?section=permissions

### PR [#1953](): POL-1163 Dangerfile Improvements
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Dangefile improvements:
> - New tests: Raise error if JSON/YAML file is added/changed within a directory intended for storing policies
> - New tests: Raise error if JSON/YAML files fail a lint test
>   - New gems `jsonlint` and `yaml-lint` have been added to `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to accomodate this
> - New test: Raise error if latest version number in CHANGELOG does not match policy
> - New test: Raise error if path statement for datasource whose host is `raw.githubusercontent.com` and whose path contains `/policy_templates/` is not pointed to a file that exists in the repository.
>   - An error will also be raised if the link does not point directly to the `flexera-public` repository, such as old rightscale links that still technically work due to forwarding but that we should stop using. 
> - New test: Raise warning if any API connections (datasource, script, or Cloud Workflow) are configured to use HTTP instead of HTTPS
> - New test: Raise warning if improperly formatted comma-separation is detected. Warning because false positives are likely but should be minimal
> - New test: Raise error if there are orphaned code blocks e.g. code blocks that are not referenced or used elsewhere in the policy.
> - Updated test: Important Files Modified test is now a single consolidated warning to save space and be more readable.
> 
> Dangefile fixes:
> - Fix: README permission test no longer incorrectly expects presence of cloud-specific credentials simply because the name of the policy references that cloud. We have a handful of cloud-specific policies that only need a Flexera credential.
>   - A new policy test has been added to compare the credentials in the policy itself to the ones in the README instead.
> - Fix: CHANGELOG formatting test no longer incorrectly reports indented secondary lists as a problem.
> - Fix: Warning about missing READY-TO-REVIEW label changed from warning to message, since adding this label does not retrigger Dangerfile and remove the warning.
> 
> Rakefile improvements:
> - Rakefile now obtains Github credential via the ENV keyword rather than a bash echo command. This should be more secure.

### PR [#1937](): POL-1158 Policy Catalog Reorganization
- **Description**:
> This PR evolved into a behemoth due to changes requiring further changes to facilitate them. This PR does the following:
> 
> ### Billing Center Access Report Policy Revamp
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Billing Center filter condensed to a single parameter and now supports both names and IDs
> - Incident summary is now derived from the name of the applied policy
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> 
> Example Applied Policy: https://app.flexera.com/orgs/28010/automation/applied-policies/projects/123559?policyId=65fb2c113ad5094c4696143c
> 
> ### Dangerfile short_description Link Test
> 
> The Dangerfile now checks for invalid URLs in the `short_description` of a policy and raises an error if the link doesn't match the location of the file.
> 
> ### Invalid short_description Link Fixes
> 
> By running a local version of the above test, I found several existing policies with bad URLs in their `short_description`. These have been fixed.
> 
> ### Github Repository Reorganization
> 
> The repository has been reorganized so that Flexera policies are in their own subdirectories based on the specific product they apply to. For example, `compliance/flexera/automation`, `cost/flexera/cco`, `operational/flexera/cmp`, etc. This makes the repository much less cluttered and much easier to find things in. MSP policies also have been moved accordingly into the appropriate `flexera/msp` directories.
> 
> The meta policy and permissions generator files have been updated to account for the new file paths.
> 
> ### Explicit Publish False
> 
> All policies that are currently unpublished due to special rules in the Rakefile have been updated to contain an explicit `publish: false` in their metadata. This means we can get rid of these special rules and have a consistent implementation.
> 
> ### Rakefile Update: `updated_at` and `recommendation_type` fields added
> 
> The Rakefile used for generating the active policy list has been updated to include two new fields. `updated_at` is an ISO-8601 datetime string indicating when the policy was last modified in the catalog. `recommendation_type` is the requivalent field from the policy's info metadata block if such a value is specified.
> 
> The Rakefile also no longer ignores policies based on location or metadata other than the `publish` field in the info block. Policies should always have this field set to false if we don't want them to be published, and this same PR updates the relevant policies to ensure that this is the case.
> 
> ### Gemfile Update: octokit
> 
> `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` have been updated to include the octokit gem. This is what enables the Rakefile to obtain metadata from Github, such as when a policy was last updated.
> 
> ### Manual Workflow Updates
> 
> The `Test Policies` and `Update Active Policy List` workflows have been updated to allow for manual execution to assist in testing changes.
> 
> ### Defunct File Removal
> 
> A handful of ancient defunct files from the RightScale days have been removed.

### PR [#1930](): FOPTS-3569 Fix: empty bill_source_expressions
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Currently when `bill_source_expressions` is empty it creates an `or` condition with empty expressions, it causes that policy breaks in runtime, specifically with this error message:
> 
> `Invalid filter: invalid #4 AND expression: attribute 'expressions' must contain at least one expression for type \\\"or\\\": invalid argument\`
> 
> So we added a condition to validate if `bill_source_expressions` is empty, if so get rid to create that `or` condition.

### PR [#1914](): POL-1131 Test Environment Update & Spell Checking
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This PR updates our testing environment and adds spell checking to our tests.
> 
> Environment:
> - Ruby is updated to 3.2.3
> - Danger is updated to 9.4
> - _danger-prose_ and _danger-rubocop_ gems have been added
> - Various other gems are updated to their current versions
> - Version enforcement is still enabled, so the above will not change if new versions are released
> 
> Spell Check
> - Uses Danger's built-in prose feature
> - Automatically runs on any changed README.md files when making a PR
> - Ignore list is located at .spellignore and has been populated based on running this test against existing READMEs and looking for good words to ignore
> - Raises warnings; will not prevent merging a PR. This is because false positives are likely.

### PR [#1910](): POL-1128 Dangerfile Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a total revamp of the Dangerfile that retains all existing functionality while also adding a couple of new checks around making sure policy blocks are in the correct order. The main purpose of this revamp is to clean up the file and get it neatly organized so that as we expand our testing, the file remains workable.
> 
> The Dangerfile is now split up into discrete neatly-labelled sections:
> - **Required Libraries**: Contains require statements to include necessary Ruby libraries
> - **File Sorting**: Sorts all of the files into neatly organized lists for later iteration.
> - **Methods**: Most tests have now been moved into discrete methods for each test. This is where those are.
> - **Github Pull Request Testing**: Run tests specific to Github and pull requests.
> - **All Files Testing**: Run tests that apply to all changed files. Currently only used for text linting.
> - **README Contents Testing**: Run tests that apply to all changed policy README files.
> - **CHANGELOG Contents Testing**: Run tests that apply to all changed policy CHANGELOG files.
> - **Misc. Markdown Contents Testing**: Run tests that apply to all changed markdown files other than the above.
> - **Policy Code Testing**: Run tests that apply to all changed policy templates except meta policies.
> - **Meta Policy Code Testing**: Run tests that apply to changed meta policy templates.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> Changes have been tested. No example applied policy for obvious reasons.

### PR [#1892](): POL-1127 Meta Policy Duplicate Incidents Fix
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Meta policies were sometimes returning duplicate results in the consolidated incident if they terminated a child policy and then replaced it with a new one, because both the old and new incident were being scraped.
> 
> This changes the meta policy template (and meta policies) to filter the child incidents so that only active incidents are considered.

### PR [#1840](): POL-996 AWS Burstable EC2 Instances Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the AWS Burstable EC2 Instances policy, including actions. From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Policy name changed to reference EC2 service directly
> - Policy now consistently gathers correct CloudWatch statistics
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Removed cooldown parameter/functionality and set default policy frequency to "monthly"
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added additional fields to incident export for added context
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if tag data has changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> - Added logic required for "Meta Policy" use-cases
> - Flexera credential now required to facilitate meta policy use cases

### PR [#1829](): FOPTS-3031 Update parameters of Azure Rightsize Managed Disk policy
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> - Updated the descriptions and labels of the IOPS and throughput parameters in the README and policy template files.
> - Updated the short description of the policy.
> - Changed the functionality of `param_min_savings`: Before this version, the `param_min_savings` parameter was used to consider the total savings (the sum of all the savings per resource) and not the savings per resource to decide whether to recommend or not. In this new version, this parameter is used to recommend or not based on the savings of each resource, just as other policies do.

### PR [#1830](): POL-1061 New Policy: Flexera Automation Outdated Applied Policies
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This new policy checks all applied policies against the same policy in the catalog to determine if the applied policy is using an outdated version of the catalog policy. An email is sent and an incident is raised with all outdated policies. Optionally, outdated policies can automatically be updated.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=65ce7e2672834a00010aa3e7
> 
> Note: The above version has been tweaked from the version in this PR to include policies that are up to date in the results. This is so the policy will actually report results in the incident and so the policy's actions could be tested.
> 
> This is because it's not possible to apply a policy from the catalog and have it be out of date without waiting for that policy to be updated in the catalog after applying it.
> 
> ### Contribution Check List
>

> From the README:
> 
> This policy checks the stored Flexera CCO billing data for Azure from 3 days ago to obtain a list of Azure Subscriptions that we have billing data for and compares that to the list of Azure Subscriptions returned by the Azure Resource Manager API. An incident is raised and email sent containing any subscriptions present in Flexera CCO but not returned by the Azure Resource Manager API, as well as subscriptions returned by the Azure Resource Manager API but not present in Flexera CCO. The user can select which of those two reports they'd like to produce.

### PR [#1804](): POL-1007 Azure Policies - Add ignore 400 error status
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Fixed error in several Azure policies where policy would fail completely when trying to access resources credential does not have access to. Policies will now simply skip these resources.
> 
> In many cases, these were regressions caused by copying and pasting from policies that did not have this update done previously. To prevent future regressions, I have gone through all Azure policies to ensure that only the correct datasources with the proper ignore_status functionality will exist in the catalog after this update.
> 
> I also did the same with a couple of minor, non-material changes to spacing to ensure consistency. In cases where this was the only change made, I did not bother iterating the version number or updating the changelog because these changes do not affect policy execution whatsoever. These changes are:
> 
> query "api-version"," -> query "api-version", " (Added space after comma)
> ignore_status [400,403,404] -> ignore_status [400, 403, 404] (Added space between numbers)
> changelog.md -> CHANGELOG.md (Renamed this file in a couple of places where it was incorrectly in lowercase)
> 
> ### Contribution Check List

> - [ ] New functionality includes testing.
> - [ ] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable
> - [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD

### PR [#1799](): POL-1055 Correct Path for Azure Blob Storage Optimization Policy
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The path for this policy is incorrect and, as a result, does not match the link in the policy's description. The path to this policy should be blob_storage_optimization, not object_storage_optimization, to keep it in line with the name of the policy itself as well as Azure’s own terminology.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> Path to this policy is now correct and matches the link within the policy itself as well as the policy name.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> N/A. No changes are made to the policy itself.

### PR [#1793](): POL-999 Azure Blob Storage Optimization Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Azure Blob Storage Optimization that brings its functionality more in line with the equivalent AWS policy while also ensuring that policy actions have been revamped for better error reporting outside of NAM. From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Added ability to assess blobs in multiple storage accounts
> - Added ability to filter storage accounts by subscription
> - Added ability to filter storage accounts by region
> - Added ability to filter storage accounts by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added ability to delete blobs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if tag data changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> - Policy now correctly requires both Azure Resource Manager and Azure Storage credentials
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> Note: Due to the nature of the credential and what this policy tests for, it is difficult to test it in our test environments. I have confirmed it works as expected in a client environment.
> 
> ### Contribution Check List

> - [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable

> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Added more robust ability to filter resources by subscription
> - Added ability to filter resources by region
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
>

### PR [#1731](): POL-1015 Meta Policy Escalation Name Fixes
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This changes the name of escalation blocks so that the meta policy generator can properly generate meta policies for these policies. I also removed some strange whitespace characters that were in one of the policies for some reason and replaced them with standard spaces.
> 
> Meta policies themselves are unchanged since separate work is being done to update the meta policy templates for new functionality, which will in turn automatically update the meta policies.
> 
> ### Contribution Check List
> 
> - [ ] New functionality includes testing.
> - [ ] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable
> - [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD

### PR [#1718](): POL-991 AWS Disallowed Regions Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the AWS Disallowed Regions policy. Both the policy itself and CWF code for actions have been updated. Most of the code was adapted from similar policies that have received similar improvements. From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if tag data has changed for an instance
> - Policy action error logging modernized and now works as expected in EU/APAC
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
>

### PR [#1727](): POL-958 Add 'Minimum Age' to Azure Rightsize SQL
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Added optional `Minimum Age (Days)` parameter to filter results by age. This is for users that want to avoid reporting on freshly created databases that, as a result of their newness, have not had any connections and would therefore be seen as "unused" by the policy.
> 
> This is not a breaking change since the default value of this parameter is 0 and this functions just like the policy did without the parameter.
> 
> From the README:
> 
> - *Minimum Age (Days)* - The minimum age, in days, since a SQL database was created to produce recommendations for it. Set to 0 to ignore age entirely.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=659c1da07cc18300018b73f7
> 
> (Note: The above does not produce an incident because we don't have any old SQL servers in our test account. If you review the log, you'll see that `ds_azure_sql_databases` returns two system databases, and the filter correctly filters out one of them based on age for `ds_azure_sql_databases_age_filtered`)

### PR [#1678](): POL-981 Azure Untagged Resources Revamp / Untagged Virtual Machines
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This PR is for several related things:
> 
> - `/data/azure/tag-support.csv` has been replaced with `/data/azure/resource_types.json` due to JSON being natively supported by the policy engine. It also contains information unrelated to tag support, so this new naming is more accurate and will allow for the file to be extended with more resource type related metadata if ever needed. The below `Azure Untagged Resources` policy is the only policy currently making use of this file, so this change should have no impact on other policies.
> 
> - `Azure Untagged Resources` policy has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. Core functionality is the same, but new filtering features were added. From the CHANGELOG:
>   - Added ability to filter resources by tag key, tag key==value, or using regex
>   - Added ability to filter resources by region
>   - Added ability to filter resources by Azure resource type
>   - Added ability to use all filters as an allow list or a deny list
>   - Added additional context to incident description
>   - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
>   - Policy now requires a valid Flexera One credential
>  
> - `Azure Untagged Virtual Machines`: This is a new policy that only checks tags for virtual machines, but due to this narrowed focus, has more functionality than the `Azure Untagged Resources` policy. The incident reports on additional VM-specific metadata, and the policy allows for powering off or deleting instances in addition to tagging them.
> 
> - The above policies now support a variety of conditionals as well as regex. Note that, while I have intentionally not documented this since it is not "to spec", using a single = will also work in order to account for user error when entering in values. From the READMEs:
>   - *Tags* - The policy will report resources missing the specified tags. The following formats are supported:
>     - `Key` - Find all resources missing the specified tag key.
>     - `Key==Value` - Find all resources missing the specified tag key:value pair and all resources missing the specified tag key.
>     - `Key!=Value` - Find all resources that have the specified tag key:value pair.
>     - `Key=~/Regex/` - Find all resources where the value for the specified key does not match the specified regex string and all resources missing the specified tag key.
>     - `Key!~/Regex/` - Find all resources where the value for the specified key matches the specified regex string.
>

### PR [#1697](): POL-1008 Google Idle Persistent Disk Recommender: Add 'Days Unattached' Parameter
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This adds the ability to filter the results by how long a disk has been unattached for. GCP produces recommendations based on whether a disk has been detached for 15 days, and this allows the user to filter those results further, going back to 90 days, by using GCP's native event logging.
> 
> This is a non-breaking change; the default value for the relevant parameter is 15 days, equivalent to what GCP already checks for, and if the user has not granted their GCP credential the permissions to access the above logs, then the policy will simply report all of the recommendations as it did before rather than fail.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=657ca1bc7cc18300018b0b66
> (Note: The above has no results because its non-trivial to make GCP produce recommendations ad hoc for testing. That said, this has also been tested in a client environment with permission and it should work as expected)

### PR [#1683](): POL-566 Policy Update Notification Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Policy Update Notification policy. The policy now works in EU and APAC, but this change required removing support for multiple projects within an org. That said, the vast majority of our users do not have multiple projects, so this is unlikely to be a major downside for most users.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Policy now works in all Flexera orgs regardless of zone
> - Policy now requires a valid Flexera One credential
> - Policy no longer makes use of deprecated APIs
> - Policy no longer reports on multiple accounts within a Flexera organization
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if applied policy name or catalog template version number changed but nothing else has
> - Improved incident export for clarity and detail
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution

### PR [#1690](): POL-817 AWS instance_types.json Casing Fix
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The Im4gn and Is4gen instance types, unlike all other types, were added to this file with the letter I capitalized. This caused issues for policies that expect consistent lowercase for this.
> 
> This is a simple fix to replace the above with their lowercase equivalents. I've searched the file for all capital letters in the alphabet and found no other instance types with this issue in this file.

### PR [#1681](): POL-757 Azure Rightsize Compute Fixes/Improvements
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is intended to fix a couple of issues with this policy, as well as implement some improvements made to other revamped policies to ensure this one is fully up to date. While this policy should continue to function without issue for most customers, a change to the `Automatic Actions` parameter does technically constitute a breaking change, hence the major version number change.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Fixed issue with resource count in incident subject being off by 1
> - Fixed minor grammar issue if results only include 1 item
> - Renamed policy actions to make it clear whether they are for underutilized or idle instances
> - Added ability to filter resources by tag key via wildcard
> - Added option to power off idle instances
> - Added ability to indicate whether to do a graceful or forced shutdown when powering off instances
> - Improved code related to incident export
> - Updated and improved code for policy actions
>

> 
> Vestas Wind Systems noticed that Azure Superseded Compute Instances policy recommends to upgrade **Standard_E16as_v4** machine to **Standard_E16as_v5**. Customer disputes this recommendation as incorrect due to current SKU provides temporary storage whilst the recommended SKU doesn’t. 
> 
> The correct recommendation would be to upgrade to SKU **Standard_E16ads_v5** with temporary storage:
> **Standard_E16as_v4** = 16 vCPUs, 128 GB RAM, **256 GB** Temporary storage
> **Standard_E16as_v5** = 16 vCPUs, 128 GB RAM, **0 GB** Temporary storage
> **Standard_E16ads_v5** = 16 vCPUs, 128 GB RAM, **600 GB** Temporary storage
> 
> Azure instance_type.json needs to be corrected as Eas v4 instances are marked as superseded  by Eas v5 instead of Eads v5

### PR [#1625](): POL-745 SaaS Manager - Deactivated Users for Integrated Applications Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is part of a broader initiative to update our SaaS Manager FSM policies to use up to date APIs. The policy itself has also been revamped along similar lines to other policies. The name has also been changed to better reflect the policy's functionality.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Policy renamed to `SaaS Manager - Deactivated Users for Integrated Applications` to better reflect its functionality
> - Added `Inactive Days Threshold` to allow user to filter out recently deactivated users
> - Added `Applications` parameter to allow user to filter results by application
> - Updated policy to use public SaaS Manager API
> - Added support for APAC API endpoint
> - Policy now uses and requires a general Flexera One credential
> - Incident summary now includes applied policy name
> - General code cleanup and normalization
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> https://app.flexera.com/orgs/27018/automation/applied-policies/projects/116186?policyId=6564f1db99745e0001588315
> 
> Note: Applied policy will not contain an incident. This is because our test environment only has one integrated application and it has no users. That said, the proper functionality of most of the policy can be verified via the logs, and the remaining functionality is identical to the existing "SaaS Manager - Deactivated Users" policy.
> 
> ### Contribution Check List
> 
> - [X] New functionality includes testing.
> - [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable
> - [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD

### PR [#1657](): POL-978 Update Default Frequency of Children to "Weekly"
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The default frequency for child policies is currently "daily", which is excessive in most cases and does not align with most child policies. This PR is to change it to "weekly"
> 
> This also fixes an issue where one of the meta policy parameters would refer to the Tag Cardinality policy instead of the name of the actual policy the meta policy is for.

### PR [#1619](): POL-968 AWS Rightsize RDS Instances Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the AWS Rightsize RDS Instances policy. The changes here are pretty numerous, but the short version is that the policy now has parity with the equivalent Azure policy and reports recommendations for both underutilized and unused databases. From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Added parameter to specify how far back to check instances for activity
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Policy now reports on both unused and underutilized RDS instances
> - Policy now reports savings for both unused and underutilized RDS instance recommendations
> - Fixed issue where policy would sometimes recommend downsizing to unsupported instance types
> - Added ability to choose between different CPU metrics for assessing utilization
> - Removed deprecated "Log to CM Audit Entries" parameter
> - Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added ability to downsize instances immediately or during next maintenance window
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if savings data changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
>

### PR [#1627](): POL-745 SaaS Manager - Unsanctioned Spend Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is part of a broader initiative to update our SaaS Manager FSM policies to use the correct API endpoints for APAC. The policy itself has also been revamped along similar lines to other policies.
> 
> Note: This policy still uses the now-deprecated internal SaaS Manager API. This is because the new API does not yet support the requests this policy needs to make to function. This functionality will be brought to the new API before the old one is decommissioned, and this policy will need to be updated again at that time.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Added support for APAC API endpoint
> - Policy now uses and requires a general Flexera One credential
> - Incident summary now includes applied policy name
> - `Expense Sum` and `Currency` are now separate incident fields
> - General code cleanup and normalization

### PR [#1613](): POL-966 Azure Rightsize SQL Fix
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> If the list of databases returned by the Azure API included entries without a valid 'sku' field, the policy would error out instead of completing. This is a fix for that; such entries are now filtered entirely, since it wouldn't be possible to provide meaningful recommendations without knowing the SKU anyway.

> Note: The above does not raise an incident and is just to confirm the policy completes. I have also tested this in the user environment where the issue was originally reported and verified the fix does work as intended.

### PR [#1615](): POL-967 Deprecate AWS GP3 Upgradeable Volumes Policy
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This policy is no longer being updated. The [AWS Rightsize EBS Volumes](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/tree/master/cost/aws/rightsize_ebs_volumes/) policy should be used for these recommendations instead.
> 
> Note that, unlike the AWS Rightsize EBS Volumes policy, this policy reports on IO1 and IO2 volumes. These volumes are high performance volumes, so changing them to GP3 will result in a performance downgrade and may cause issues for workloads that rely on this performance.
> 
> Effectively, this policy was just recommending the above change without regard for actual usage data, which is a bit reckless and shouldn't be done. A future version of the AWS Rightsize EBS Volumes policy may include this functionality, but it would be alongside actual analysis of metrics to determine if the downgrade makes sense.

### PR [#1602](): POL-960 Update AWS Reserved Instances Utilization - add ability to filter by Billing Center
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> <!-- Describe what this change achieves below -->
> Adds functionality to the policy so that a user can filter current reservation purchases by Billing Center. 
> 
> As we cannot currently support RBAC on reserved instances within the platform, this will allow for owners of Billing Centers to only receive the list of reservations (and their respective utilizations) that are applicable to their BCs, and not see all reservations at a global level.
> 
> If the user does not specify a specific list of billing centers, the policy operates in the same way it did prior to this change.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> <!-- List any existing issues this PR resolves below -->
> - Fixes README title to reflect policy template name.
> - Fixes README "Credential Configuration" section to reflect the credentials required to run the policy.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> <!-- URL to the Applied Policy that was used for dev/testing below -->
> <!-- This can be helpful for a reviewer to validate the changes proposed resulted in the expected behavior. If you do not have access or ability to apply the policy template, please mention this in your PR description.-->

### PR [#1576](): POL-944 Fix Azure Savings Realized for new Azure EA Connections
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This policy did not work correctly for clients using the new Azure EA bill connect method. This corrects that issue. The policy now obtains a list of bill connections from Optima and tailors the requests to the Optima API based on which bill connections exist. The policy should now work with both old and new connections and collect costs from both if both are present.
> 
> I've done a pretty thorough investigation/testing of this in a client account, and I am confident that we are now pulling the correct data.
> 
> It's likely that this policy will be changed to use the savings value in Optima once that feature is available for Azure, but this PR will ensure the policy at least continues to work as expected for users using the new EA bill connections in the meantime.

### PR [#1577](): POL-957 AWS Rightsize EC2 CloudWatch Fix
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This fixes several issues with how CloudWatch data is pulled that would occasionally cause incorrect results. Specifically, the date range we pull data for is now rounded down to the nearest hour. This is to ensure that the range is neatly sliced by the period we specify so that we only get one result back from CloudWatch for each metric.
> 
> Previously, it would sometimes imperfectly slice the data, giving us two results, the first being for less than an hour of time and the second being the number we actually needed, but when this happened, the policy grabbed the first number instead. As a backup, just in case somehow the above doesn't work, the policy now grabs the last item in the list of values instead of just grabbing [0] every time.
> 
> Additionally, I spotted a couple of issues where the lookback period was not being correctly used to adjust our request to the amount of days the user specified. Those have been fixed as well.

### PR [#1534](): POL-941 Meta Policy Extension
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This modifies several policies in order to add meta policies for them. The generator script has also been modified to autogenerate these meta policies going forward.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> No examples, but an "fpt check" was run against all modified policies and the new meta policies. The changes themselves are fairly minimal and should not affect policy execution.
> 
> ### Contribution Check List
> 
> - [X] New functionality includes testing.
> - [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable
> - [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD

### PR [#1557](): POL-947 Azure AHUB Utilization with Manual Entry Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Azure AHUB Utilization with Manual Entry policy. From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Fixed bug that would cause policy to raise error if incident contained no results
> - Added logic required for "Meta Policy" use-cases
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Added ability to filter resources by subscription either via allow or deny list
> - Added ability to filter resources by region
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if irrelevant metadata changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> - Policy now requires a valid Flexera One credential
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> Extra fix: I saw a small error in the Azure Unused IP policy's CHANGELOG file. This also corrects that.

### PR [#1519](): POL-930/931 New Marketplace Products Policies
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> AWS New Marketplace Products: This policy compares AWS billing data from 3 days ago to billing data from a user-specified number of days ago (10 by default) to see if any new Marketplace products have been purchased since then. A list of the new products and their estimated monthly cost is raised as an incident and, optionally, emailed.

A list of the new products and their estimated monthly cost is raised as an incident and, optionally, emailed.
> 
> Notes:
> - Azure version will work with both the old and new style bill connections and has been tested with both.
> - Since these policies leverage Optima rather than cloud provider APIs, no meta policies were created, as they are not necessary.
> - These have been categorized as "cost" policies since their purpose is to help users find and mitigate unexpected expenses, but since we are not necessarily recommending that they terminate Marketplace services, metadata has not been added to facilitate scraping into the Optimization dashboard.

### PR [#1523](): POL-838 AWS Savings Plan Recommendations Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the AWS Savings Plan Recommendations policy. In addition to the usual updates, the policy also now performs currency conversion where appropriate.
> 
> Note on currency conversion:
> 
> - The AWS API that produces the recommendations also includes a currency code. Conversion is done when this currency code does not match the currency code on the Flexera org. A statement in the incident details specifies the currency converted from, the currency converted to, and the exchange rate used. This should enable users to calculate the original unmodified values if desired.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Policy now automatically converts savings from USD to local currency when appropriate
> - Removed parameter to do the above manually via a user-specified exchange rate
> - Added exchange rate context to incident to allow user to derive unmodified USD values when needed
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and intuitive to use
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> - Policy now requires a valid Flexera credential
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> Due to the nature of the API request made in this policy, it cannot effectively be tested in our internal testing accounts. I have confirmed it works elsewhere and can provide a sample incident upon request.

### PR [#1513](): POL-912 Google Idle Cloud SQL Instance Recommender Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Google Idle Cloud SQL Instance Recommender policy. In addition to the usual updates, the policy also now performs currency conversion where appropriate, and also allows the user to take action (stop or delete) against idle resources.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Policy now requires a Flexera credential
> - Policy now converts savings to local currency when appropriate
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold
> - Added ability to filter resources by project and by region via an allow list or a deny list
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple label key:value pairs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added additional fields to incident export to facilitate scraping for dashboards
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if savings data changed but nothing else has
> - Added ability to stop or delete Cloud SQL instances from policy/incident
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> - Added logic required for "Meta Policy" use-cases
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> Due to the nature of how Idle SQL recommendations are produced (only instances >30 days are even considered), it's difficult to produce an incident showing that the policy works as expected. Below is the link to a successful policy execution with no incident; you can view the logs and see that it did indeed find a valid Cloud SQL instance, but no recommendations for it:

- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Azure Reserved Instances Recommendations and Savings Plan Recommendations policies. In addition to the usual updates, the policy also now performs currency conversion where appropriate.
> 
> Note on currency conversion for Reserved Instances Recommendations:
> 
> - The Azure API that produces the recommendations does *not* include a currency code. The currency code is found via a call to the Azure Billing API.
> - Conversion is done when the above currency code does not match the currency code on the Flexera org. A statement in the incident details specifies the currency converted from, the currency converted to, and the exchange rate used. This should enable users to calculate the original unmodified values if desired.

### PR [#1530](): POL-940 Fix Pricing Info in AWS Rightsize EBS Volumes
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The policy was revamped with the assumption that the AWS Price List API would report hourly pricing for EBS volumes, similar to how it reports EC2 pricing. It turns out that this API reports monthly pricing, which means the math to convert it from hourly pricing resulted in highly inflated values.

### PR [#1511](): FOPTS-1503 Added new cost dimensions for savings calculations
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The following dimensions were added to the average cost per hour calculation:
> 
> - operating_system
> - database_engine
> - database_edition
> - license_model
> - deployment_option
> 
> In addition, the way of obtaining the costs per hour for each type of instance was changed. Previously, all possible combinations of instances were obtained, obtaining a cost for each combination of instance_type and region (for example, if we have 100 different instances_type and 15 regions, we would obtain 1500 average costs, even though many were not necessary according to the records obtained from the API). By adding the 5 new dimensions, this approach becomes impractical, since it would increase exponentially for each combination of operating system, database engine, database edition, etc.
> 
> So it was decided to use a map with a key composed of
> ` instance_type---region---operating_system---database_engine---database_edition---license_model---deployment_option`
> to filter the cost records obtained from the API that match that combination, to subsequently calculate the average cost per hour of the records with purchase_option = "On demand" and thus calculate the estimated savings of the records of the other purchase_option (Reserved, Savings Plan, Spot)

### PR [#1492](): POL-830 AWS Rightsize EBS Volumes Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the AWS Rightsize EBS Volumes policy that adds new functionality and meta policy support. The most notable changes are:
> 
> - The API calls to CloudWatch, and subsequent calculations for IOPS percentage, were removed because they had no bearing on the recommendations produced and simply added unnecessary permissions requirements for the user.
> - The ability to action on resources directly from the incident has been added. This functionality has been successfully tested.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added ability to take automated actions to upgrade GP2 volumes to GP3
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Removed unneeded `IOPS Average %` and `Lookback Period` fields from incident export
> - Removed unneeded API calls to CloudWatch
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Added additional fields to incident export to facilitate scraping for dashboards
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if statistics or savings data changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy

### PR [#1497](): POL-913 Google Idle IP Address Recommender Revamp / Google Meta Policy Automation
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Google Idle IP Address Recommender policy. The most notable change is that the policy will now convert the savings reported by Google to the Flexera org's currency when appropriate.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Policy now requires a Flexera credential
> - Policy now converts savings to local currency when appropriate
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Removed deprecated "Log to CM Audit Entries" parameter
> - Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold
> - Added ability to filter resources by project and by region via an allow list or a deny list
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple label key:value pairs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added additional fields to incident export to facilitate scraping for dashboards
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if savings data changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> - Added logic required for "Meta Policy" use-cases
> 
> Additionally, this pull request also contains changes to our scripting for generating meta policies so that they can be generated for Google policies in a style very similar to what is done for Azure. 
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> While we do have a test environment for GCP, recommendations can take some time to actually be generated. I have tested this policy in a client environment and verified it works as expected and can provide the incident it produced upon request.
>

> https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=65171b69ac11110001c8ed3d
> 
> (I have also tested the CWF by modifying the policy temporarily to report on IP addresses that have no recommendations. The delete action works as expected)

### PR [#1486](): POL-924 Oracle Cloud CBI Broken Upload Fix
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> If a file upload were to fail for some reason, such as the policy engine running out of memory or a network issue, that individual file would remain in an "in-progress" status indefinitely. This would result in the policy never being able to successfully commit the bill upload as a whole, resulting in the policy stalling out.
> 
> This is a fix for the issue. If such a broken file upload is found, the policy will simply abort the bill upload and create a new one, starting the entire process over.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy

### PR [#1479](): POL-910 AWS Rightsize EBS Volumes - Remove GP3 Recommendations and Empty Recommendations
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> <!-- Describe what this change achieves below -->
> - Reintroduced logic to filter out gp3 volumes from recommendations
> - Changed data for policy incident to ensure a policy incident is not created when there are no recommendations
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> <!-- List any existing issues this PR resolves below -->
> - Fixes issue with policy where $0 recommendations are returned for gp3 volumes, which are currently not supported for recommendations.
> - Fixes issue with policy where some child policies have a single recommendation, and that recommendation is completely empty. This was caused by the 'message' field in the data, which is passed even if there are no recommendations.

### PR [#1370](): POL-749 Azure Hybrid Use Benefit for Windows/Linux Server Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit for Windows Server policy as part of the general audit on usage and rate reduction policies. In addition to the usual updates to match functionality to the other revamped policies, the policy also now reports savings and has metadata to facilitate scraping into the optimization dashboard.
> 
> (Changes unrelated to reporting savings were also ported to the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit for Linux Server since the effort to do so was minimal. Additional discovery will be needed to determine if and how we can calculate AHUB savings for RHEL or SLES VMs.)
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold
> - Added ability to use Subscription list parameter as either an "allow" list or a "deny" list
> - Added ability to filter resources by region
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Added estimated savings to incident export
> - Added additional fields to incident export to facilitate scraping for dashboards
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution

### PR [#1455](): POL-840 Azure Rightsize SQL Databases Revamp 
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Azure Rightsize SQL Databases policy as part of the general audit on usage and rate reduction policies. In order to have parity with the Azure Rightsize Compute policy, and to avoid duplicate recommendations, this policy now reports on both unused and underutilized SQL databases via distinct incidents. A parameter allows the user, if desired, to report on only unused or only underutilized instances, retaining existing functionality.
> 
> The policy now also offers savings estimates for rightsizing opportunities. For underutilized resources, the cost of the instance is divided by the current capacity of the instance and then multiplied by the recommended capacity of the instance to determine the new cost if the instance were downsized. This is then subtracted from the current cost of the resource to determine the savings. This works because pricing for Azure SQL databases is straightforwardly a multiple of the capacity assigned to it within a given tier. For example, a Standard instance with a capacity of 50 costs 5x what a Standard instance with a capacity of 10 costs. 
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Removed deprecated "Log to CM Audit Entries" parameter
> - Added potential savings to recommendations
> - Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold
> - Added incident for unused instances based on lack of connections
> - Added ability to delete unused instances
> - Added ability to configure how many days back to consider when determining if instance is unused or underutilized
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added ability to filter resources by region
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if statistics or savings data changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
>

> 
> Note: Both downsize and delete actions have been tested successfully. Cost data has been confirmed to work as well, but this data is not meaningfully available in our Flexera Services test account. CPU average data is also working but reports as 0 in the incident because the average CPU usage for this instance is 0.004032258064516129, which rounds down to 0 when reducing it to 2 decimal points. This can be confirmed by viewing the applied policy log.

### PR [#1441](): Azure Unused Volumes Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Azure Unused Volumes policy as part of the general audit on usage and rate reduction policies. The changes to this policy are roughly analogous to the changes made to the AWS version, using the same code and verbiage where appropriate. From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Removed deprecated "Log to CM Audit Entries" parameter
> - Removed ability to filter by how long a policy was detached; see README* for more details
> - Added ability to filter by volume age
> - Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if ages or savings data changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> 
> From the README:
> 
> Note: Previous versions of this policy had the option to filter results by how long a volume was detached. This functionality did not work as expected due to Azure volume logs not recording detachment events. Such events are recorded in the logs of the VM the volume was detached from, and there is currently no way to determine the most recently attached VM for a volume through Azure's APIs. For this reason, this functionality was removed.

### PR [#1440](): POL-847 Policy Automated Updates On Releases (Part 1)
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> When new policies are created, or when existing policies are updated, it can be difficult for users of policy templates (whether that be Customers or internally) to understand the changes that were made, and in many cases the user might not be aware of the change altogether.
> 
> As a result, we must provide a mechanism to ensure timely and effective communication of policy template updates to users.
> 
> See [Internal Communication of Policy Feature Updates](https://flexera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FP/pages/2287141043/Internal+Communication+of+Policy+Feature+Updates) for more details.
> 
> This change adds:
> 
> - a Ruby Script that takes information from the Policy Template Changelogs, 
> - a GitHub Actions Workflow YAML file that automatically updates a Microsoft Teams Channel when changes have been made to a template, or if a new template has been created.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> Internal Policy Templates Users are automatically updated with the most recent Policy Template changes/additions.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy

> N/A

### PR [#1408](): POL-903 Fixed Cost Data Issue with New Azure APIs
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The casing and naming conventions of some dimensions, such as the Service field, are different between the old method of ingesting Azure bills and the new method. For example, “Microsoft.Compute” is now “microsoft.compute”. This update enables our cost optimization policies to pull this data regardless of casing.

I have also confirmed that this change works as expected in a client org that I was developing for, which is where I discovered the issue to begin with.)

### PR [#1404](): POL-842 Azure Unused IPs Revamp
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a revamp of the Azure Unused IPs policy as part of the general audit on usage and rate reduction policies. The changes to this policy are roughly analogous to the changes made to the AWS version, using the same code and verbiage where appropriate. From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Removed deprecated "Log to CM Audit Entries" parameter
> - Added ability to specify how long an IP address should be unattached to consider it unused
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Added additional fields to incident export to facilitate scraping for dashboards
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if savings data changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution

### PR [#1401](): Support Tag Filtering For Key Without Value ("*" Support)
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This adds the ability to filter by key:* on the AWS usage reduction policies to support use cases where the user doesn't enforce a particular value and just needs to filter by the presence of a particular key.
> 
> This also fixes an issue that prevent tag values from being read properly from AWS volumes. This issue actually existed before the recent revamp as well, but has now been fixed.
> 
> Meta policies have also been regenerated, but this only changes the description of the exclusion tags parameter and should have no impact on existing applied meta policies.

### PR [#1381](): Azure Meta Policies: Dimension Filtering
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This updates the Azure meta policy template (and meta parent policies) to have the dimension filtering that the AWS meta policies have. This is to facilitate use cases where the user may want to filter on a dimension other than Azure subscription name or ID and to keep functionality as similar as possible between AWS and Azure meta policies.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> Since these changes require actual functional Azure billing data in the org to enable the policy to work correctly, I do not have an example policy. That said, I did test these changes in a client org that is hoping to benefit from these changes and they worked as expected.

### PR [#1356](): Azure Meta Policy Update
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The meta policy generation has been updated to generate metapolicies for Azure policies, and those metapolicies have been generated. The child policies have also been updated to include support for metapolicies.
> 
> **Breaking changes** are made to many of these policies to get them to conform with what the meta policy script expects. This mostly involves changing the name of *param_subscription_allowed_list* parameter to *param_subscriptions_list* and changing the name of the Azure credential block from *azure_auth* to *auth_azure*. In a small number of policies, a Flexera credential was added that did not exist previously.
> 
> Note: Warnings about Azure meta parent policies lacking READMEs can safely be ignored.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> A handful of issues were fixed in the child policies that were discovered during this process. The details are included in the CHANGELOG files.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> Below are child policies just to show that the child policy updates did not break the policies.
> The meta parent policies can't be easily tested until after this merge is complete, but the risk here is low since those are not published in the catalog anyway.

### PR [#1348](): POL-868 Remove Deprecated Azure RI Recommendations Policy
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This PR removes the deprecated version of the Azure RI Recommendations Policy. It also renames the directory containing the valid one from "mca_recommendations" to just "recommendations" to match the other clouds in the repo and because the policy is not just for MCA.
> 
> The diff is going to look a little wonky because GitHub shows it as me changing the files in "recommendations" instead of deleting and replacing them, but no actual modifications were made to the policy itself.

### PR [#1354](): POL-878: Azure Rightsize Compute Instances Memory Support and General Improvements
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This adds support for memory metrics and brings over a bunch of the improvements being made for the AWS version of this policy to the Azure version.
> 
> Azure now supports memory usage ("Available Memory Bytes") via the Insights API, so this data is straightforwardly pulled from the same API that CPU data is pulled from. The percentage is calculated by finding the total memory of the instance's SKU via the Microsoft.Compute/skus API and then doing the appropriate calculations.
> 
> From the CHANGELOG:
> 
> - Several parameters altered to be more descriptive and human-readable
> - Removed deprecated "Log to CM Audit Entries" parameter
> - Added ability to only report recommendations that meet a minimum savings threshold
> - Added support for memory metrics along with relevant parameters
> - Added ability to configure how many days to consider CPU/memory statistics for
> - Added ability to filter resources by multiple tag key:value pairs
> - Added ability to make recommendations based on maximum CPU/memory usage
> - Added additional context to incident description
> - Normalized incident export to be consistent with other policies
> - Added human-readable recommendation to incident export
> - Policy no longer raises new escalations if statistics or savings data changed but nothing else has
> - Streamlined code for better readability and faster execution
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> https://app.flexera.com/orgs/6/automation/applied-policies/projects/7954?policyId=64b1457a12688300016785e1
> 
> (Note: Savings will show 0 for the above example due to the test environment. I've confirmed independently that the savings field works as expected in a normal environment)

### PR [#1340](): FOPTS-1072 - Turbonomic policies with token refreshed follow schedule
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Refreshing a cookie causes Turbonomic applied policies to restart, so in case the refresh policy runs more often than the turbonomic policy, we get unnecessary runs. In this PR we try to minimize the number of refreshes based on the frequency of policy runs (the refresh policy will decide if update is needed based on its frequency and next scheduled run of the policy to update).

### PR [#1352](): fix: Meta Parent Parser GitHub README URLs
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> On GitHub Actions the path to policy template included multiple matches for `policy_templates/` -- i.e. `/.../policy_templates/policy_templates/.../`.  This was causing the script to fail because it was using `split("policy_templates/")[1]` -- which is not correct.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> This change uses regex to find and replace everything from the start of the fully expanded path, up to the last `policy_templates/` -- which should work better.

### PR [#1334](): Azure Price File Fix and AHUB Update
- **Description**:
> It was discovered that certain prices were wrong due to the inclusion of specialized pricing (such as spot pricing). This has been fixed; now every instance should be listed with its standard on-demand price.
> 
> In addition, a new field has been added containing the AHUB price. This was determined by looking at the DevTestConsumption price, which MS has confirmed is the same as AHUB pricing in the below URL. pricePerUnitAHUB is set to null for instance types that do not qualify for AHUB.
> 
> The script has also been updated to include the above changes.

### PR [#1335](): Oracle Bill Upload Fix
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Fixes an issue where, if OCI actually removes files between runs of the policy, the policy would never commit the bill upload because the number of files uploaded would be greater than, rather than equal to, the number of files in the bucket for that month.
> 
> The policy now commits the upload if the number of files is greater than or equal to instead. Extremely simple fix.

### PR [#1310](): FOPTS-939 - Add policy to refresh Turbonomic authentication token
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This policy is designed to refresh the authentication cookie used to authenticate with Turbonomic APIs. It addresses the challenge of using a cookie-based authentication method in Turbonomic, which is not supported by Flexera due to its outdated nature and the industry trend of switching to newer and more secure authentication methods. As Turbonomic plans to implement bearer token authentication in the future, this policy serves as a temporary workaround for the integration to connect to Turbonomic APIs.

### PR [#1299](): FOPTS-957 Google Idle Compute Instances policy timing out
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> https://flexera.atlassian.net/browse/FOPTS-957
> 
> The policy *Google Idle Compute Instances* is timing out with client tenant, so some optimizations successfully applied and tested in other Google policies like *Google Idle VM recommender* (this policy is very similar) were applied to enhance the performance, now the policy makes less API calls and processes less data thanks to GCP Monitoring Query Language.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> Optimized the execution time of the policy by using the following approaches:
> - CPU utilization data is now retrieved using GCP Monitoring Query Language; before, the Flexera platform did the calculations, but now those are done faster on GCP resources.
> - Memory utilization data is now retrieved using GCP Monitoring Query Language; before, the Flexera platform did the calculations, but now those are done faster on GCP resources.
> - Instance data is now retrieved using a much faster API endpoint that retrieves the data of all the instances in every zone.

### PR [#1301](): Oracle Bill Ingestion README Update
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Updated the README for the Oracle Bill Ingestion policy to place special emphasis on the policy frequency. I have run into multiple instances recently of users setting the frequency to "daily" instead of leaving it at the default of "15 minutes", and this causes the policy to never manage to upload all of the files and commit the bill upload.

### PR [#1290](): Updating Cost Savings Policies For Scraping
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This updates all of our cost savings policies to conform with the specification documented below. This should eliminate the need to rely on the policy name itself.
> 
> https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/CreateRecomendationFromPolicyTemp.htm
> 
> One major omission is the Azure Rightsize SQL Databases policy, which currently doesn't even report savings at all and probably needs a fundamental rework to get it in alignment with other similar policies.

### PR [#1288](): Azure Unused Volumes - Bug Fixes
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Two bugs were discovered when attempting to use this policy with a client. First, the subscription filtering was not working and would generate an error. Second, the policy was not properly reporting savings (which also would sometimes cause the policy to generate an error). 
> 
> Additionally, because the tags were stored as an object in the incident, they were not properly visible in the incident output. This has been changed so that the tags are presented as a string.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> The above described issues are resolved.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> No example policy but I did test the fixes in the client's environment and both work as expected.
> 
> No README changes since functionality of the policy has not changed. These are just bug fixes.

### PR [#1269](): FOPTS-805 Fix the method used to match recommendation and resource data at GCP Recommender policies
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The current method we use to match data is producing duplicated entries because the resource name attribute is being used to match recommendations data and resource data, a more unique identifier such as an id needs to be used instead.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> - The method to match resource data and cost data was changed in the policies:
>   - Google Idle VM Recommender
>   - Google Idle IP Address Recommender
>   - Google Idle Persistent Disk Recommender
>   - Google Cloud SQL Idle Instance Recommender
>

### PR [#1255](): Fixed the minimum and maximum values of the incident report of the Google Idle VM recommender policy
- **Description**:

> - Fixed the values shown at `cpuMaximum` and `cpuMinimum`:

> At version 2.5 we changed the way we calculated the CPU utilization, we retrieved the average of utilization of each day and then we selected the maximum average as the maximum and the minimum average as the minimum, now we show the actual maximum and minimum of the CPU utilization thanks to a change in our GCP MQL query.

- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> mysql_flexible_tier_types.json has been updated with the following fixes and improvements:
> 
> - up_sku and down_sku keys have been added, since not every sku cleanly upscales or downscales to something with the same name.
> - Lists were resorted to be more logical and readable.
> - Standard_E80ids_v4 is no longer listed as a recommended SKU size for any of the other SKUs, since it is an odd one-off SKU. There are upsize/downsize recommendations for this SKU though.

### PR [#1266](): POL-823 OCI Bill Ingestion Fixes/Improvements
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This is a minor overhaul of this policy to fix bugs, improve usability, and ensure the policy follows best practices.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> - Fixed bug that occasionally caused duplicate or missing cost data. This was caused by relying on timeModified instead of timeCreated when determining which objects to send into CBI.
> 
> - Added option to run for previous month along with relevant parameter. The README was also updated to recommend that users apply the policy twice, once for the current month and once for the previous month, to ensure that any changes made to the bill after the month ends (a common thing for cloud providers) are incorporated into the platform.
> 
> - Added regex to ensure that user-specified billing periods are valid. Self-explanatory why this would be a good thing.
> 
> - General code cleanup and modernization. In particular, some code was refactored to make more effective use of underscore.js, datasources were paired with their respective scripts instead of having a distinct section in the policy for each, and comments were added to explain the branching logic of the policy.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> We do not have a shared test environment where I can link to an applied policy, but I can confirm that I have tested this new policy with a customer (Banco de Chile) and it works as expected.

### PR [#1263](): POL-782 Azure Unused Volumes Modernization
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> <!-- Describe what this change achieves below -->
> Originally, the intend was to modify this policy to pull Microsoft.Insights stats in bulk to speed up policy execution.
> 
> That said, I discovered that, in most scenarios, pulling these stats per resource (with one every API request per resource) was faster, since there is no way to pull stats per subscription without pulling a bunch of stats unrelated to volumes, and the pagination required to gather all of that data made execution actually take longer when using this approach, and also has a higher risk of causing memory issues.
> 
> So instead, I left the original method in place but did the work of cleaning up the code to bring it up to modern standards. Actual functionality is unchanged from the original policy, but the code now follows our current standards in terms of naming conventions, organization, and readability.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> <!-- List any existing issues this PR resolves below -->
> Code now conforms to our expectations.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy

### PR [#1253](): POL-809: Enhancements for AWS Savings Plan Utilization
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Improves usability of AWS Savings Plan Utilization policy for the `Inform` phase:
> 
> - Parameter `Savings Plan ARN` is now optional.  If not provided, the policy will return utilization for all Savings Plans in the account.
> - Default threshold changed from `70` to `100`.  This policy template will send an e-mail for all Savings Plans by default now.
> - Payer Account ID added to the Incident Summary.  This is helpful for users with multiple AWS Payer Accounts.

### PR [#1257](): FOPTS-717 Remove limit for the threshold parameter for Budget Alert Policy
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Threshold currently allows up to 100%. This parameter doesn’t accept an input that is above 100% (i.e. max budget). For many customers they are comfortable with a budget over run of up to 105% or 110%. Suggestion is to allow values over 100% to be entered by the user while applying the policy

### PR [#1246](): POL-785 - Add support for attached volumes to the `AWS Unused Volumes` Policy Template
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> <!-- Describe what this change achieves below -->
> The policy has been updated to detect attached volumes, unattached, or both based on customer preference, dictated by a new parameter Volume Status. A new field to the export statement, Status, was added to show the volume's current status.
> 
> Appropriate CWF code was added to ensure that attached volumes are detached before being deleted (and this has been tested; poor vol-0dc3f4692c6a6d88d never saw it coming). Detaching happens before both snapshot and deletion.
> 
> I also cleaned up some of the policy code to modernize it and improve readability. Basic functionality is unchanged apart from the above.
> 
> Finally, the CWF template was modified to add DetachVolume to the permissions for this policy, since that is now needed for full functionality.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> <!-- List any existing issues this PR resolves below -->
> N/A. This is to add functionality. I did review the policy to look for any implementation errors but nothing looked problematic.
> 
> ### Link to Example Applied Policy
> 
> <!-- URL to the Applied Policy that was used for dev/testing below -->

> 
> Once merged, please merge the following pull request to update the meta policy for this policy. The existing one will still work but won't support the new parameter (and thus will default to unattached volumes only):

> - Fixed issue causing resources without a rightsizing or termination recommendation to appear in the incident.
> - Fixed issue affecting calculation of total savings for underutilized resources.
> - Removed non-functional downsize escalation from idle compute instance incident.
> - General code cleanup and modernization.
> 
> That last item is pretty extensive. I went through this policy with a fine tooth comb to find anything that might be causing incorrect calculations or other issues. The result changes so much that I'd actually recommend just reviewing the new file outright instead of the DIFF.
> 
> I have tested the results of this new version of the policy and validated that it works as expected compared to the previous version, albeit with the fixes described above.

> 
> The version is also bumped from 2.9 to 3.0, so even if the above is considered a "breaking change" (I imagine most customers have a Flexera credential at this point), the major version number also changed.

### PR [#1140](): POL-693 AWS Instance Rightsizing - Merge Idle Instances and Inefficient Instance Utilization
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> As part of this PR - produce one policy for rightsizing that includes a threshold for idle (default <5%) and underutilized (default <40%) - options for both CPU and RAM stats (if available from log sources).  Cost savings for idle as per current policy.  Cost savings for rightsizing = 50% of idle calculation (i.e. assumption next instance size down = 50% cheaper).  Bring in instance size recommendations from current Inefficient Utilization policies.

### PR [#1168](): POL-753 Azure Idle Compute Instances - fix exclusion tag filter logic
- **Description**:
> I discovered an issue where the tag key filtering was not working correctly. It seems like there are edge cases where, depending on the credential permissions and level of access, the Azure API returns values for the "tags" field that the original policy did not handle correctly, resulting in all VMs being filtered, and thus no results being generated, even if the tag filter parameter was left blank.
> 
> I reworked the relevant script block so that it no longer has this issue, and I've tested it in our testing environment to ensure that the policy works as expected both when filtering by tag key and when leaving the field blank.

### PR [#1104](): feat: DescribeRegions filter out not-opted-in
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> [`ec2:DescribeRegions`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRegions.html) returns all regions by default -- even those not opted into yet.  New regions by default are not opted into as well, so this combination has resulted increased policy template errors when running without specifying region whitelist [`param_allowed_regions`].  
> 
> This change filters only regions that are `opted-in` or `opt-in-not-required` in the current account
> 
> ### Contribution Check List
> 
> - [x] All tests pass.
> - [X] New functionality includes testing.
> - [X] New functionality has been documented in the README if applicable
> - [X] New functionality has been documented in CHANGELOG.MD

### PR [#787](): Fix non-optimal array searching for costs
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> - A number of Policy Templates for cost were looping through all of the costs they have retrieved from Optima on each iteration in order to find the costs relevant for each particular resource. This is inefficient and potentially causes evaluation timeouts that could be avoided. Instead, a map of only the relevant costs to resource IDs is constructed and used for fast lookups during iteration.
> - Cleaned up some whitespace and spelling issues.

### PR [#660](): POL-417: top 10 cost categories not just for current month.
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> The scheduled report policy template was building a list of top 10 values (categories) for the considered dimension by cost, but based on the current month only, not all months in the data. If there was no data for the current months, that top 10 list would be empty => everything ended up lumped into the "Other" bucket.
> 
> The fix is to considered all the data to build that top 10 list by cost, and not just the current month.

### PR [#657](): CET-977 Use GitHub GraphQL for enforcing branch protection
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Current issues:
> 
> - **GitHub Api Rate limit**: Running current version every hour or less will consume too many calls from the limit.
> - **Default Branch**: In the current version is not possible to protect the default branch, it only accept a list of branches which can be different from the real default branch.
> - **Minimum configuration**: Current version doesn't change the protection configuration if it doesn't match the parameters, it only checks if there is a branch protection
> 
> This PR is fixing the top two issues by using GitHub GraphQL API to grab the data with less api calls (e.g.: 6 calls for flexera with 550 repos) and also to check the default branch instead of using a branch list.

### PR [#651](): Configurable Optima org for AWS Old Snapshots and AWS Unused Volumes
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> Adds a parameter to the AWS Old Snapshots and AWS Unused Volumes policy templates to override the Flexera One org ID to use when querying Optima for cases when the project is not in the same org where the AWS bill is registered in Optima. The default value for this new parameter is `current` which duplicates the old behavior of using the `rs_org_id` keyword to get the current org ID, so the new behavior will only be triggered if a different org ID value is entered in the parameter. This behaviour is needed in order to get useful cost/savings estimates from these policies for the Flexera FinOps Team's use case where various engineering Flexera One projects that are associated with AWS accounts are not in the same org where we have the AWS bill registered in Optima.

### PR [#619](): Fix AWS Regions with SCP for FinOps Policies
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> - Update the AWS Unused Volumes, AWS Old Snapshots, and AWS Unused IP
>   Addresses policy templates to use the actual calls to determine if
>   each region is available via SCP since we have discovered that using
>   `DescribeRegions` in each particular region does not work reliably
>   (the `DescribeRegions` call could be enabled for all regions while
>   other calls are not).
> - Add the Code Spell Checker extension to the suggested VS Code
>   extensions and fix up some misspellings it found.
> - Removed confusing ignored `host "ec2.amazonaws.com"` lines from all of
>   the `ds_regions` datasources.

### PR [#515](): Pol 263 Azure Unused IP Addresses
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This Policy Template scans all IP addresses in the given account and identifies any unused IP addresses. If any are found, an incident report will show the IP addresses, and related information, and an email will be sent to the user-specified email address. If the user approves that the IP addresses should be deleted, the policy will delete the IP addresses. Optionally, the user can specify one or more tags that if found on an IP address will exclude the IP address from the list.

### PR [#469](): PHX-2039 Basic convert_table tool
- **Description**:
> This is a sample tool to create the data table for you. Some caveats:
> * This is meant to be a throwaway tool used once.
> * This just does the data table, not the the selectable actions parts as well. Those can probably be done by hand or using mass search and replace in an editor or something as they're more rote
> * This just gets you roughly there and tries to do the tedious and error prone parts for you, not meant to be super thorough or perfect. Lots of the more complicated tables didn't convert super well, I've left comments as needed with clarifications. Leave comments if you have any questions on that PR, will leave it open as a reference for a little bit.
> 
> I made a temporary PR with a run of the tool just for discussion purposes, no need to merge it. I'll leave it up to the policy devs to apply this tool, fix up the output, commit and test, etc as they can get to things.

> Azure Disallowed Regions - Separate ticket has been created to resolve delete resources issue POL-182, hence the policy has not been included in this pull request.
> Azure Instances Utilization from Log Analytics - This policy has been already merged to master with the credential service changes in POL-101.
> Azure Publicly Accessible Managed SQL Instance - Positive scenario is working fine, hence adding the policy to this pull request but created separate ticket to modify the policy to achieve empty tag list scenario, POL-181.

### PR [#390](): Pol 42 aws instances not running flexnet inventory agent
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This policy checks all EC2 instances running in AWS to determine if the FlexNet Inventory Agent is running on the instance and reports on any that are missing the agent.
> The policy is a recommendation only policy, no action is taken during the Policy Escalation.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> The policy leverages the cloud API to get all current EC2 instances and the FlexNet Manager report (Custom view) API to get all AWS cloud instances with an agent. It cross-checks the two lists to determine if any instances are running on the cloud that isn't known to FNM.  The policy matches the InstanceCloudID from FNMS and the instanceId from AWS.

### PR [#348](): Pol 43 check for azure instances not running fnms agent
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> 
> This policy checks all instances running in Azure to determine if the FlexNet Inventory Agent is running on the instance and reports on any that are missing the agent.
> The policy is a report only policy, no action is taken during the Policy Escalation.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> 
> The policy leverages the cloud API to get all current instances and the FlexNet Manager report (Custom view) API to get all azure cloud instances with an agent. It cross-checks the two lists to determine if any instances are running on the cloud that isn't known to FNM.  The policy matches the ComputerName from FNMS and the VirtualMachine.name from Azure.

### PR [#265](): POL-37 Check for Unencrypted S3 buckets
- **Description**:
> Initial version for POL-37.
> 
> ### Description
> 
> This policy checks all S3 buckets in the AWS account and reports on any that do not have default encryption set. When an unencrypted S3 bucket is detected, the user can choose to enable default encryption (AES-256) and the user can also choose to delete the unencrypted S3 Buckets by enabling 'delete action' as mentioned in Enable delete action section below.
> 
> ### Issues Resolved
> When an unencrypted bucket is detected, an email action is triggered automatically to notify the specified users of the incident. Users then have an option to modify configuration after manual approval, and even Users can perform delete action if required.
> 
> - encrypt - modifies the configuration of the unencrypted S3 Bucket by enabling the Default encryption i.e. AES-256

### PR [#130](): Issue 126 uav delete error handling
- **Description**:
> ### Description
> Handles error when deleting volumes.
> Now if a volume can't be deleted (e.g. it has a lock on it), the volume is tagged with the cloudexception error if applicable and then moves on to the next volume.
> The applied policy will try to delete volumes each time it is run so that if the issue causing the deletion failure is removed, the policy will delete the volume on the next scheduled or on-demand run.

> Change the @clouds datasource to only include AWS, Google and Azure.
