### PR [#3091](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/3091): POL-1510 Repository Cleanup

#### Description

> We've started to receive complaints from both internal and external users that the large number of deprecated policy templates in the catalog is causing confusion. Additionally, the repository itself has become a bit cluttered due to old and unused assets.
>
> This PR solves this by making the following changes:
>
> - All policy templates that were both deprecated and unpublished have been deleted. These are almost all very old policy templates that are defunct and not useful. This will have no impact on the catalog itself (since they were unpublished) but will declutter the repository a bit. The repository history can still be used to obtain these files in the unlikely event that they are needed for something.
> - All published deprecated policy templates have been unpublished. This should remove them from the catalog and make it less confusing and cluttered. None of these policy templates were recently deprecated, and the files remain in the repository if a user needs them.
>
> Unfortunately, due to several factors, we do not have a simple way to proactively reach out to users about these changes. That said, none of these files were newly deprecated or newly unpublished (prior to this PR), so users have had in most cases over a year to make any necessary changes. Existing applied policies will be unaffected.

### PR [#3080](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/3080): POL-1506 Account RBD Policy Updates

#### Description

> This updates the unpublished policy templates for generating RBDs from account tags to play nice with each other. By making use of dummy rules to delineate the beginning and end of the rules generated by the policy templates, they can now be applied simultaneously and will not overwrite each other's work. Additionally, rules manually added in the UI will not be deleted.

### PR [#3017](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/3017): POL-1469 Dangerfile Fixes/Updates

#### Description

> * Updated Ruby and node packages to update versions and solve potential security vulnerabilities.
>
> * Added CodeQL configuration file so that we can enable CodeQL scanning for additional security on PRs.
>
> * Updated Dangerfile "policy_missing_master_permissions?" test to ignore policy templates with `skip_permissions: "true"` in their info block for policy templates with unusual permissions that won't properly scrape or other extenuating reasons we might not want to scape them for permissions.
>
> * Updated Dangerfile "policy_bad_block_name?" test to work when the block name is in single quotes instead of double quotes. Previously, the test would fail to capture a bad block name in this situation.
>
> * Added new Dangerfile "policy_block_name_single_quotes?" test to check if block names are in single quotes instead of double quotes.
>
> * Added new Dangerfile "policy_defunct_metadata?" test to check if defunct metadata fields such as tenancy are used.
>
> * Added new Dangerfile "policy_abbreviated_info_field?" test to ensure consistent naming of info() fields and to avoid abbreviations like CCO, MSP, etc.
>
> * Added new Dangerfile "policy_missing_info_block?" test to report when the info() block is missing entirely. Stolen shamelessly from Bryan.
>
> * Updated existing policy templates so that they will pass the above tests. Also changed these policy templates to pass existing tests as warnings and errors arose from modifying them.

### PR [#2957](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/2957): FOPTS-7277 Excluded fields to avoid sent email each execution

#### Description

> The client has been receiving error notification emails about invoice processing approximately 3 to 4 times per hour. Additionally, the client mentioned that this issue is impacting their ability to manage invoices efficiently and has requested a solution to reduce the frequency of these error notifications, as they are unnecessary and do not add value to resolving the billing issues.
>
> ### Issues Resolved
>
> We are including 'hash_exclude ` "created_at"`,`"updated_at"` to ensure that changes to these fields do not trigger an email notification unless a significant modification occurs. At the same time, we are adding `result = _.sortBy(result, 'created_at')` to ensure that the collection is ordered by 'created_at'. Without sorting, the collection may arrive in a different order, which could unnecessarily trigger a new email notification even when the "incident" contains the same information but in a different sequence.

> This PR changed the way to calculate "used memory" for Azure instances.
> Previously the policy is trying to compute "used memory" by substracting "available memory" from "total memory".
> This PR has changed to directly retrieving "available memory" from Azure metrics.
>
> The previous method had flawed if the "total memory" is changed due to instance resizing.

### PR [#2892](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/2892): POL-1433 Use Flexera CCO Costs for Azure Rightsize Managed Disks

#### Description

> This updates the Azure Rightsize Managed Disks policy template to use Flexera CCO to obtain costs for managed disks. Calculations of savings now incorporate this to give more accurate estimates. From the CHANGELOG:
>
> - Savings are now calculated using cost data stored in Flexera Cloud Cost Optimization instead of only via Azure list price.
> - Currency conversion functionality has been removed. It is no longer needed due to actual cost data stored in Flexera Cloud Cost Optimization being used to assess cost and savings.
>
> From the README:
>
> The `Estimated Monthly Savings` is calculated via the following:
>
> - The `monthly list price` of the current disk type obtained via the Azure Pricing API.
> - The `real monthly cost of the disk` is calculated by multiplying the amortized cost of the disk for 1 day, as found within Flexera CCO, by 30.44, which is the average number of days in a month.
> - The percentage difference between the two is calculated by dividing the `real monthly cost of the disk` by the `monthly list price` of the current disk type.
> - The `monthly list price of the new disk type` is multiplied by the above percentage to get an `estimated real monthly cost of the new disk` type under the assumption that any discounts or other changes from list price that applied to the old disk type will also apply to the new one.
> - The savings is then calculated by subtracting the `estimated real monthly cost of the new disk type` from the `real monthly cost of the disk`.

### PR [#2833](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/2833): POL-1405 Replace deprecated Kubecost endpoints for Kubecost Cluster Policy

#### Description

> The endpoint we are currently using has been deprecated “/model/savings/clusterSizing"
> It still works but only returns one cluster rather than all clusters.
>
> The new endpoint is returns a different response “/model/savings/clusterSizingETL" and simply adding ETL onto the end of our current end point in the policy returns null values in ds_cluster_sizing
>
> This endpoint returns all cluster recommendations in one response.
>
>
> The `ds_clusters` function has been created  to include two new parameters in the Kubecost API call:
>
> * param_allow_shared_core: This boolean parameter indicates whether shared cores should be allowed in the cluster sizing calculation. By default, Kubecost may not consider the shared cores between pods as part of the cost savings calculations. With this new parameter, the explicit inclusion of shared cores in the calculations can be enabled. This is useful for environments where resources are shared between multiple pods, and a more accurate estimate of potential savings is desired.
>
>
>
> #### Changes Made:
>
> * Updated the function responsible for the API call to /model/savings/clusterSizing
> * Added the param_allow_shared_core to the `ds_clusters` function.
> * Updated the HTTP call to send these parameters in the Request.
> * Set the default values of these parameters to False, meaning shared cores will not be allowed.
>
> > How the response for the new endpoint differs from what we initially wanted: we modified it and added new functions to handle the response and convert it to the expected struct
>

### PR [#2869](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/2869): POL-1414 Currency Conversion Functionality on Kubecost cluster rightsizing policy

#### Description

> This update introduces functionality to handle automatic currency conversion within Kubecost cluster rightsizing policy, ensuring that incidents reflect values across different currencies.
>
> #### Changes
>
> * Support for multiple currencies has been added to the system.
> * If the kubecost config endpoint returns an empty currency, USD (United States Dollar) will be used as the default currency.
> * A condition has been implemented where, if Kubecost's currency matches Flexera's, no currency conversion will take place.

### PR [#2808](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/2808): POL-1402 Azure Rightsizing Compute: Consider Managed Disk

#### Description

> This updates the `Azure Rightsize Compute Instances` policy template so that it never recommends a downsize to a size that wouldn't support the current number of attached disks for an instance.
>
> The [Virtual Machine Sizes - List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtual-machine-sizes/list?view=rest-compute-2024-07-01&tabs=HTTP) API call is used during policy execution to get a list of resource types and the maximum number of attached disks. The policy template has been given a major version change since the above API call requires an additional permission.

### PR [#2756](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/2756): POL-1387 New Object Storage Lifecycle Policies / Deprecate Object Storage Optimization Policies

#### Description

> This adds two new policy templates, `AWS S3 Buckets Without Lifecycle Configuration` and `Google Cloud Storage Without Lifecycle Configuration`, to the policy catalog. Additionally, it deprecates the `AWS Object Storage Optimization`, `Azure Blob Storage Optimization`, and `Google Object Storage Optimization` policy templates. The READMEs for these policy templates now direct users to the appropriate lifecycle policy templates instead.
>
> Reason: Due to the scale involved, policy templates that attempt to manage individual objects within object storage buckets are not efficient or, in most cases, even able to run without errors on the Flexera platform. It is bad practice to attempt to micromanage individual objects anyway; users should instead be configuring their cloud environment to automate this via the lifecycle tools all three hyperscalers provide for their object storage solutions. The new policy templates ensure that we have a policy template solution available to users interested in enforcing the usage of lifecycle tools.

### PR [#2712](https://github.com/flexera-public/policy_templates/pull/2712): POL-1139 New Policy: AWS S3 Usage Type Rule-Based Dimension

#### Description

> This new unpublished policy template, `AWS S3 Usage Type Rule-Based Dimension`, creates a single rule-based dimension based on the usage_type values for AWS S3. The intent is to provide a more general and human readable alternative to the built-in dimension, whose values tend to be very specific and not very human readable.
