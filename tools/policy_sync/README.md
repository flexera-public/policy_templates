# Policy Template Synchronization Tool

## What it does

This Policy Template can be used to synchronize (upload, overwrite, or alert) RS built-in policy templates in your account. It uses a json file stored in the github directory to determine a set of RightScale's current policy templates and then compares them with your current account policies (using the version) to take appropriate action.

## Prerequisites

This policy uses [Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for authenticating to datasources -- in order to apply this policy you must have a Credential registered in the system that is compatible with this policy. If there are no Credentials listed when you apply the policy, please contact your Flexera Org Admin and ask them to register a Credential that is compatible with this policy. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential(s).

- [**Flexera Credential**](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) (*provider=flexera*) which has the following roles:
  - `policy_designer`
  - `policy_manager`

The [Provider-Specific Credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ProviderCredentials.htm) page in the docs has detailed instructions for setting up Credentials for the most common providers.

## Usage

- The Policy Template Synchronization Policy Template will need to be uploaded to your account and set active.
- There are currently two actions: `Email` and `Email and Upload`.
- When you choose `Email` you will get an alert on the the policy templates that can be updated, and no further action will be taken.
- When you choose `Email and Upload`, you will get an alert on the policy templates that can be updated and we will upload those policies to your account.
